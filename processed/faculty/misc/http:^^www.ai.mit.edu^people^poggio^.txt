Professor Tomaso Poggio





I currently hold the Uncas and Helen Whitaker Professorship of
Vision Sciences and Biophysics at the
Department
of Brain and Cognitive Science
at MIT, and am also affiliated to
MIT's Artifical Intelligence
Laboratory
. In addition,
since 1993, I have been Co-Director of MIT's
Center
for Biological and Computational Learning (CBCL)
.

My original training is as a theoretical physicist (I received a
Ph.D in Theoretical Physics from the University of Genoa in 1970)
and my current research focuses on the application of new learning
techniques to time series analysis, object recognition, adaptive
control and computer graphics.
