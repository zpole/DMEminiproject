Areas of Research
My main area of interest is programming languages, especially program analysis and compiler optimization.  Recently, I have been working on constraint-based program analysis algorithms, including constraint theories, complexity, algorithms, and implementation issues.  A demonstration constraint-based type inference system,
Illyria
, is available.
I'm also interesed in so-called "end user programming", or how to
make programming accessible to non-programmers.  Toward this end, I'm
involved in developing two special purpose languages:
Tioga
, a database visualization system that makes it easy for
people without visualization expertise to turn relational data into pictures,
and
TREE
, a project to make conversion between data formats
simple without the use of arcane sed, awk, and perl scripts.

Biographical Sketch
Alex Aiken received his Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Music from
Bowling Green State University
in 1983 and his Ph.D. from
Cornell University
in 1988.  Alex was a Research Staff Member at the
IBM Almaden
Research Center
before joining the Berkeley faculty in 1993.  He is
married to
Jennifer Widom
, and they have a young son
Tim
.  Jennifer has
photos
from the couple's travels in the pre-baby days.
