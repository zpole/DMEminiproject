Education

1995  Ph.D.  The Hebrew University  Computer Science
1990  M.Sc.  The Technion           Computer Science
1985  B.Sc.  The Technion           Information Systems Engineering


Research Interests

Distributed systems, communication protocols, conferencing, and
replication.
Currently, I am building the Distributed Systems and Communication
lab at the Department of Computer Science here at Hopkins, and
also am affiliated with the Center of Excellence in Space Data
and Information Sciences
(CESDIS)
,
The Goddard Space Flight Center,
NASA.

The main project in the Distributed Systems and Communication
lab is
Commedia
, a cross-platform
infrastrcuture for multimedia conferencing. Commedia will combine a
reliable multicast toolkit
(Spread) with video, voice, graphics, and application sharing
over local and wide area networks. The development is done over
BSDI Unix and WIN95. We are just strating, so it is not too late
to join!

Since I received my B.Sc., I gained vast experience in building
distributed systems. I spent six years building such a defense
system, heading a 50 man-years effort and delivering an operational
solution to the customer.
Subsequently, I spent four years researching and building (i.e.
playing with) distributed systems, network protocols and replicated
databases. And guess what: I even got a PhD for that :)
I was one of the initiators and main participants of the
Transis
project with Professor
Danny Dolev
at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. Transis is a group
communication tool that supports reliable multicast services over
a partitioned network. Transis utilizes the hardware unreliable
multicast where possible, optimizing the performance for existing
networks.
I also took part in building the
Totem
group communication protocol with Professors
Melliar-Smith
and
Moser
at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Other people I enjoy collaborating with, are
David Breitgand
,
Gregory Chockler
,
Nabil Huleihel
,
and
Avishai Wool
.
