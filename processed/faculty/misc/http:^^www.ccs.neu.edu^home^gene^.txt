A few of my selected papers are available
by ftp
.
I also have a description
of a
task-oriented parallel abstraction
,
along with software, related papers, abstract, and large computations
carried out using that abstraction.
Among recent and current projects,
I was involved (with G. Michler) in organizing a workshop on
High Performance Computing and Gigabit Local Area Networks
in Essen from April 29 to May 3, 1996
(also see European copy)
.  I am organizing
East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD-97) in Spring, 1997.
I am on the program committee for
HPDC-6
(High Performance and Distributed Computing, Aug. 5 - 8, 1997;
cf. also
HPDC-5 program (1996)
).
This fall quarter three of us are leading a
seminar
in distributed systems.  This fall, I am also teaching a graduate course
on
computer architecture
.
Other random pointers of interest to me follow.
