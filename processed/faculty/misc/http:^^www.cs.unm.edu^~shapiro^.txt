Associate Professor Henry D. Shapiro





Wenn der Kummer naht,
Liegen wüst die Gärten der Seele,
Welkt ihn und stribt die Freude, der Gesang.
Dunkel is das Leben, ist der Tod.


Li-Tai-Po (701-763)
(Translated from the Chinese by Hans Bethge)
from Das Lied von der Erde
by Gustav Mahler









When sorrow draws near,
Wasted lies the gardens of the soul,
Withered and dying are joy and song.
Dark is life, is death.


(English translation by Deryck Cooke)









Professor Henry D. Shapiro received his Ph.D. in
computer science from the University of Illinois in 1976. His main
research interests are in the areas of algorithmic paradigms,
implementation and empirical assessment of algorithms and
data structures, and heuristics for NP-hard problems. He has
over 20 refereed papers and is co-author (with Bernard Moret)
of a graduate text in algorithms. An intermediate-level text on
case studies in programming and an introductory text on
Mathematica
were recently published.
