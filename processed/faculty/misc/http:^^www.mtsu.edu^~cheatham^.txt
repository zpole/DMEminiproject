About Dr. Tom Cheatham




Dr. Tom Cheatham

Professor and Department Chair


Educational Background
Dr. Cheatham obtained his Bachelor of Science degree at Campbellsville College in 1966. He received his Masters degree in 1968 and Ph.D. in 1971 from the University of Kentucky.

Dr. Cheatham taught mathematics and computer science at Samford University
in Birmingham Alabama from 1971-1980.  In 1980, he accepted a position in
the Computer Science Department at Western Kentucky University where he
taught nearly every course in the BS and MS programs before leaving in
1990 to become Chair of the Computer Science Department at MTSU.  In 1987,
Dr. Cheatham was selected as Western Kentucky University's Outstanding
Teacher, an honor which he still cherishes.  Even as department head,
teaching is still very much a part of his life and an endeavor to
which he commits much energy and time.  Dr. Cheatham also enjoys
cooperative research and a game of racquetball with his students
and friends.
