Research:


Communication and synchronization in parallel and distributed computers including
communication protocols, synchronization protocols, routing algorithms, fault-tolerant
interconnection networks, and techniques for creating portable parallel applications.

Current Projects:


Portable and Repeatable Parallel Applications:

The goal of this project is the creation of software
that will help application developers
write correct message-passing code.  The software will
take a trace of the communication
events in an MPI (Message Passing Interface) application
and determine if the application
will always yield the same results given the same inputs.
The software will use a novel
type of vector clock in order to detect race conditions.

Fault-Tolerant Communication Networks:

This project studies how communication networks can be
designed to tolerate a small
number of faults.  There are two main goals: 1) the
design of networks that can support
pipeline (1-D) computations efficiently in the presence
of faults, and 2) the creation of
techniques that prevent deadlock despite faulty switches or wires.
