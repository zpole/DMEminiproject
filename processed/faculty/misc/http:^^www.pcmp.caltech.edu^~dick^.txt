I'm a Visiting Associate in Caltech's
Computer Science Dept.
affiliated with the
Computation and Neural Systems Program
and
Carver Mead
's
Physics of Computation

Group
.
(Look for me in the new Moore building on Wednesdays.)

The rest of the time,
I work my day job at
Apple Research Labs
,
where I'm a distinguished scientist.


My research involves models of perception, with
emphasis on Analog VLSI, DSP, and Auditory Computation.
At Apple I've mostly been doing Neural Nets and
Handwriting Recognition lately.

For more about what I do, see my
career highlights
and my other
home page at Apple
.


Some of my
research papers
and
patents
are available online.
