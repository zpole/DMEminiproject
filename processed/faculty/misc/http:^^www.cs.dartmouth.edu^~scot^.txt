Robert L. (Scot) Drysdale, III


Robert L. (Scot) Drysdale, III, Professor


Ph.D.
Stanford University
, 1979.

Research Interests:

Professor Drysdale's research area is algorithms, primarily
computational geometry. Much of his work has dealt with
computing a structure called the Voronoi diagram and its
geometric dual the Delaunay Triangulation. In particular,
he has invented algorithms for computing the Voronoi Diagram
of line segments, for Voronoi diagrams when distances are
measured by Convex Distance Functions, and for Voronoi diagrams
which simulate crystal growth.  He has found ways to use
the Delaunay triangulation to find fixed-radius near neighbors,
to find the k nearest neighbors of each point in a set, and to
enumerate
pairs of points in increasing order of interpoint distance.
Professor Drysdale has also done work on computing greedy
triangulations and has been working with a Mechanical
Engineer in the area of Numerical Control (NC) machining.
