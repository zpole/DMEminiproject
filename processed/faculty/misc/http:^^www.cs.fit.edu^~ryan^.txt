Activities


CIS Comprehensive Exam

Local chapter of the ACM

CS Program's facilities committee

Research

The hypermedia document
SML Synopsis
is an introduction to the programming language SML.

The hypermedia document
Trestle by Example
is a description of the Modula-3 library Trestle.
Trestle is used to build X-Window applications.

Other sundry papers of mine in gzipped, PostScript format:


Explaining type errors in polymorphic languages

Solving diagramless crossword puzzles

The calculation of Easter

Type reconstruction for coercion polymorphism (SAC)

Method reuse in typed object-oriented languages

Modula-3 as a Database Programming Language

Understanding concurrent Ada programs

Miscellaneous

In fact, I do not think that the search for high-level programming languages
that are more and more satisfactory from a logical point of view can stop
short of anything but a language in which
(constructive) mathematics can be adequately expressed.

Per Martin-LÃ¶f

Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell,
Principia Mathematica
,
volume 3, second edition,
Cambridge University Press,
Cambridge, England,
1927,
page 91
.

Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege,
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik
,
volume 2,
H. Pohle, Jena,
1903,
end of section 143 "Aufbau,"
page 178
.

If you use the Web browser "chimera" you may be
interested in the origin of the imaginary being
called the
Chimera
as explained by Jorge Luis Borges.

The novel
The Name of The Rose
by Umberto Eco ends with the phrase:
"stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus."
Eco explains this himself
in a
postscript
.

My favorite city is
Munich
,
Germany
