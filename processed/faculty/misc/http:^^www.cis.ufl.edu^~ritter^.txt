I'm Chairman of the

Computer
and Information Science and Engineering Department
.



Research Interests
My research interest is computer vision.  My work in this area has led
to the development of UF's image algebra, an algebraic notation for
specifying computer vision and image processing transformations.  CRC
Press has recently published a book
(
Handbook of Computer
Vision Algorithms in Image Algebra
) that I wrote with
Joe Wilson
.  It provides
specifications of over 80 computer vision and image processing
algorithms using image algebra.
