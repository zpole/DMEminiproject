Kang
G. Shin

Kang G. Shin is Professor and Director of the
Real-Time
Computing Laboratory
(RTCL) in the
Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science
department at the
University
of Michigan
.

His research interests include real-time fault-tolerant computing, QoS-guaranteed
wireline &wireless networking, real-time control and its application
to reconfigurable manufacturing systems, and OS & tools for distributed
embedded applications like automobiles and modern buildings. Currently
he leads several major projects, including:


HARTS
: Distributed real-time multicomputer system addressing issues ranging
from a low-level HW architectures to real-time OS and evaluation tools.

Interconnection
networks
:
Interactions among switching, routing and scheduling
at HW level.

QoS-guaranteed
networking
: Development and evaluation of various protocols that
guarantee such QoS as end-to-end delays & jitter bounds, error rate,
and bandwidth.

Open-architecture
controller
: An ERC thrust area dealing with the development of real-time
control and monitoring SW with flexibility and reusability.

ARMADA
A Real-time Middleware Architecture for Distributed Applications
