I am an associate professor of Computer Science, with special research
interests in
machine
learning
and free-text information retrieval.  Virtually all of
this work has been done with students, as part of a research group we
call the
Cognitive Computer Science Research
Group
.  I've tried to give an overview of the research we've done
in the sections  below.  If you
are looking for a particular paper, you can proceed directly to the
References
section, where a number of them can be found online.
