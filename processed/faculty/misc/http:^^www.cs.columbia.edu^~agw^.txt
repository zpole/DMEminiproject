Art Werschulz



Netsurfers are encouraged to jump to my
hotlist
.


My "real" position is Professor of Computer Science at
Fordham University
(Fordham College at Lincoln Center, to be precise).
I have been a Visiting Scholar in the
Columbia University Computer Science Department
since 1982.
I do work in
information-based complexity
.
My special interests include the following:

Complexity of partial differential equations.
Complexity of integral equations.
Complexity of ill-posed problems.
Here are some recent papers.


The complexity of definite elliptic problems with noisy data


The complexity of the Poisson problem for spaces of bounded mixed derivatives


What is the complexity of solution-restricted operator equations?


The complexity of multivariate elliptic problems with analytic data

I also maintain
CAC-NET/FoCM-NET
,
an electronic conferencing system for researchers in continuous algorithms and
complexity and in foundations of computational mathematics.
