Professor James D. Hollan received a Ph.D. from the University of Florida
and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University. He was
on the faculty of the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) for
a decade. During that period he directed the Future Technologies Research
Group at NPRDC and, in collaboration with Professors Edwin Hutchins and
Donald Norman, led the Intelligent Systems Group in the Institute for Cognitive
Science at UCSD.
Professor Hollan left UCSD to become Director of the MCC Human Interface
Laboratory and subsequently established the Computer Graphics and Interactive
Media Research Group at Bellcore. In Fall 1993, he became Chair of the
Computer Science Department at UNM.  His primary research interests are human
computer interaction and computationally-based media and
communications.
