RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIPS


RESEARCH INTERESTS:
The design and analysis of distributed systems
and network protocols,
from both correctness and performance aspects.

My current work is on:

Assertional methods for concurrent/realtime systems,
particularly layered systems as found in operating systems
and networking.
The Z-iteration,
a numerical method for fast performance prototyping
of adaptive high-performance systems,
such as integrated-services networks.
The Z-iteration provides accurate time evolutions
of probabilistic measures
at a cost several orders cheaper than simulation.
Recent work includes
minimal latency transport protocols,
scalable ToS/policy routing,
MaRS routing testbed,
link-state vs distance-vector routing.
