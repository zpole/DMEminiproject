Lane A. Hemaspaandra, URCS Faculty Member

Note: Pre-marriage name = Lane A. Hemachandra.
b. 1960. Ph.D. (1987) Cornell University. Assistant Professor (87-88),
Columbia University. Assistant Professor (89-92), Associate Professor
(92-present); University of Rochester. Presidential Young Investigator
(89-95).
Professor Lane Hemaspaandra's research area is computational
complexity theory. In computational complexity theory, the various
tasks with which computers may be faced are divided into groups --
known as complexity classes -- according to the types of computational
power and the computational models they use. The relative power of
those classes is then studied, with the goal of discovering the
weakest level of computational power that suffices to solve the
crucial problems posed to computers today.
Professor Hemaspaandra's particular interests include the power of
counting-based computation, the power of probabilistic computation,
the power of unambiguous computation, the importance of query order
when accessing databases, the study of efficient algorithms for
complex sets, and complexity-theoretic aspects of security,
fault-tolerance, data compression, and political science.
