Teaching
I am currently (Fall 1996)  teaching the following courses:


CS 475: Artificial Intelligence 1
CS 575: Artificial Intelligence 2


Research
My research is within Artificial Intelligence and has the following main aspects:


representing and reasoning about mental states of agents


understanding metaphorical descriptions of
mental states in natural language discourse


connectionist approaches to knowledge representation and reasoning
.
The work on aspects 1 and 2 mainly uses symbolic AI techniques.

The work on aspect 3 is largely a separate line of research, though its main
focus is on bridging the gap between connectionism and symbolic AI.
I have done
some work
on the
question of applying connectionism to the task of representing and reasoning
about mental states (= Aspect 1).


Selected Publications




mental states
(no metaphorical or connectionist angle)

mental states and metaphor


connectionism
(except as related to mental states, analogy or metaphor)

connectionism and analogy-based reasoning
(related to metaphor)

connectionism and mental states
.

That's it for now.
