Rick Bunt

B.Sc. (
Queen's
),
M.Sc., Ph.D. (
Toronto
)






I am a faculty member at
the
University of Saskatchewan
,
where I teach and do research in computer systems in the
Department of Computer Science
.
I am the Department's Graduate Chair for 1996/97.
More information about our graduate
program is available from the
Department's Home Page
.
Please direct all graduate program inquiries to the Department's
Graduate Secretary
.
In broad terms, my research relates to computer systems design and
performance evaluation, with a particular focus on
operating systems, distributed systems, and computer networks.
Details of specific research projects are given below.
I collaborate in these areas with researchers at Saskatchewan and elsewhere,
including
TR
Labs
,
IBM Canada's Centre for
Advanced Studies
in Toronto, and
Hewlett-Packard
.





Classes for 1996/97

I am teaching three classes this year:


Fall Term:



CMPT 215.3

Introduction to Computer Organization and Architecture


CMPT 815.3

Computer Systems and Performance Evaluation



Spring Term:
(We have no
winter
term in Saskatchewan)

CMPT 115.3
Principles of Computer Science





Research Projects



At the U of S, my research activities are rooted in
the
DISCUS Research Group
, a group
we (
Derek Eager
,
Carey Williamson
,
and I) formed to consolidate our common research interests in the
performance of distributed computing environments.
Along with
my graduate students
,
I am presently engaged in a variety of projects, including:


system and networking issues in mobile computing


multi-level file caching in client/server environments


performance issues in OSF DCE
(as part of
the
MANDAS project
in collaboration with IBM Canada and colleagues
at five other universities)

network management in ATM networks
.


Recent papers in these and other areas are available from
the DISCUS
ftp server
, along with completed theses of recent students.


Other University and Professional Activities

I sit as a Council member in the
College of Graduate Studies
and Research
and am a member of the Board of Directors of the University of
Saskatchewan
Faculty Club
.
I am also active within
ACM
SIGMETRICS
, the special interest group for performance measurement
and modelling.

Other Interests

My head may belong to the University of Saskatchewan,

but my heart is with
the Saskatchewan
Roughriders
(the 1989 Grey Cup champs and hosts of the hugely successful
1995 Grey Cup),
the Toronto Blue Jays
(the 1992
&
1993 World Series champs), and
the Boston Bruins
(soon to be Stanley Cup champs again).
I also play third base for the 1994 & 1995 league and tournament champion
Black Velvet Bandits
of the University of Saskatchewan Fastball League.
And, of course, the
U of S Huskies
,
the 1990 Vanier Cup Champions, will get their licks in '96.
