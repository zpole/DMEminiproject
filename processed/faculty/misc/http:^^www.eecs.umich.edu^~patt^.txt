Home page: Yale N. Patt


(or, at least my first attempt at this.  I have finally succumbed to all that insistance that I must
have a home page, so here goes.  With a little effort, this might work itself into reasonable
shape.  We'll see.)

Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
Actually, I do have a
more nearly current
picture,
which was taken in a museum in Cyprus in June, 1995 by Greg Egan, professor at
Monash University.

Once I get things straightened out, there will be links to:


EECS 100
, a serious Introduction
to Computer Science and Computer Engineering for
Undergraduate majors in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.

HPS
: My research group.
Our industrial affiliates program in the Computer Science Division at Michigan IPoCSE.
a reasonably current cv, in ascii, suitable for reading.  Postscript is available for the asking.
My views on Education.
My views on Computer Architecture.
Other recent drivel that I have generated and feel compelled to share with you.
