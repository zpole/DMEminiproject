I am a professor in the
Computer Science Department
at
Columbia University
in
New York City
.
My interests lie in the area of natural language processing and in particular,
natural language generation. We are currently working in three main areas.
The first,  summary generation, involves the generation of natural
language text, or summaries, from data such as stock market statistics. We
are also investigating text summarization by integrating our work on
summary generation with a text interpretation system. In the second,
statistical natural language, we are using statistical analysis of large text
corpora to identify constraints on how words are used. Such results can be
used to automate the development of a lexicon, or dictionary. Finally, we are
also working on the generation of multimedia explanation, developing
techniques to coordinate language and graphics, to produce explanations in
the context of a human computer interface for medical information. Part of
our interest here is on the generation of spoken language and differences
with generation of text.
