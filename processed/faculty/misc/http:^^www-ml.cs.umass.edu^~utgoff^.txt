Research

I am interested in various forms of decision tree induction.  I
maintain a system called ITI, which is described in a
technical report
.  The
source code and
program documentation
are also available.  More recently, I have
been developing a test selection metric based on Kolmogorov-Smirnoff
distance, which is also described in a
technical report
.

I am intrigued with problem of how to find good features
automatically while learning a value function, particularly in game
playing.  I have been thinking about practical methods for exploring a
space of feature functions.  One such approach is described in a
recent
technical report
.  This is where I'm spending most of my time.

I have developed an approach to writing game-playing programs that
compete with one another over the internet.  The approach does not
require a central server, and it allows anyone on the internet to run
a contest of player programs located anywhere on the internet.  This
approach is described in a
technical report
.  Code distributions are available for
Othello
,
Hearts
, and
Checkers
.  We have an active Othello group, and a Hearts group of
about ten people has just formed in conjunction with seminar on
Adversary Search being taught Fall 1996.  My own principal interest in
game playing pertains to the representational issues in finding good
features, but I am very interested in the search aspects too.

David Aha maintains a
list
of people with
interests in machine learning and case-based reasoning.

Service

I am currently serving on the Editorial Board of Machine Learning Journal,
and the Organizing Committee of ICML-97.

Teaching

During Fall 1996 I am teaching the
Data Structures
course, and
a seminary on
Adversary Search
.
