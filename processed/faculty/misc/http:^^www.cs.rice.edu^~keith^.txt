Keith D. Cooper

Associate Professor
Department of Computer Science
Rice University





Research Interests
Keith Cooper's research interests include compilation for modern
microprocessors, classical code optimization, and
interprocedural analysis and optimization.
He is project director of the
Massively
Scalar Compiler Project
at Rice.
In an earlier life, he was one of the principal designers and
implementors of the Rn and ParaScope programming environments for
FORTRAN.  These systems served as a testbed for research in various
compilation issues for scalar and parallel machines.  The current

D System
project is a descendant of those early systems.
Of course, being an academic, he produces both
papers
and
code
.
