"Each says something about the nature of the world, and, though
individually he adds little or nothing to our understanding of it,
still from the combination of all something considerable is
accomplished."
(Aristotle, Metaphysics)

"For as the eyes of bats are to the brightness of daylight, so is
the reason in our soul to the things that by nature are the clearest
of all."
(Aristotle, Metaphysics)
