Research areas
I am interested in building systems that can act intelligently in the real
world. To this end, I work on a broad spectrum of topics in AI. These can
be grouped under the following headings:


Formal foundations
: provably intelligent systems

Machine learning
: including
Adaptive Probabilistic Networks


Real-time decision making


Decision making under uncertainty
: including the
BATmobile project

I also work on the
RoadWatch
project with
Jitendra Malik
,
funded by CalTrans and JPL, which will ``provide real-time,
intelligent traffic surveillance for the nation's freeways and cities.''
