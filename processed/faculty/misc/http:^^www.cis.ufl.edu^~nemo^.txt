Check out the
newest addition
to the Newman-Wolfe household:)
I'm a faculty member with the
University of Florida's

Computer
and Information Sciences Department
.
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
University of Rochester Computer Science Department
in Rochester, NY in 1986.
My undergraduate education was carried out at New College in Sarasota, FL,
and at Eckerd College in St. Petersberg, FL, where I met interesting guys
like
Mark Pauline
, see the pointer to SRL home page, below.
For more, you may check my 2-page postscript
curriculum vita
.
I chair the Colloquium Committee, which joins with Barr Systems, Inc. to
bring the community the
Barr Systems Distinguished Lecture
Series for 1995-1996.

Networks and distributed systems are my main interests,
although complexity theory still excites me.
I am working with networking faculty and staff toward an
NSF instrumentation grant
for teaching networking in the labs that CISE
should have starting Spring of 1997 :).
Recent Courses:


CIS 6930/CIS 4930 Cryptology
(Fall 96)

CEN6505 Computer Communication Networks
(Fall 96)

COP 4600 Operating Systems
(Spring 96)

CEN4500C Fundamentals of Computer Networks
(Spring 96)

CIS 6930/CIS 4930 Computer and Network Security
(Fall 95)

COT 6315 Formal Languages and Theory of Computation
(Spring 95)
My office hours are MW 2:00-4:00 pm.
My
spring 1996 schedule
is also available.
I am the Associate Director for Digital Signal Handling and
Satellite Networking in the NASA-sponsored
Space Communication Technology Center
.
I, Dr. Chow and several students are engaged in characterization of errors and
error correction methods on satellite channels, especially those using the
Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS).
We meet Thursdays at 10:30 in CSE-319.
I am also a researcher in the
Software Engineering Research Center (SERC)
,
headquartered at
Purdue University
.
I have worked with
Prasun Dewan
(at
UNC Chapel Hill
)
on supporting distributed collaboration for software engineering.
Several students and I are working on DCS v2 (Distributed Conferencing
System, version 2) and we meet T at 11:00 in CSE-344.
Here I am with Jayne Valenti Miller, the SERC research coordinator, and
Johna Johnson, editor for Data Communications, in New York City on a
recent trip for SERC.

On campus, I serve on the Council on Information Technologies and Services
(CITS) and chair the Networking and Telecommunication Standing Committee
(
NTSC
) of CITS.
The NTSC provides advice and suggests policy to CITS, which reports to
the provost.
In the community, I volunteer with the Copeland Community Organic Farm,
and have designed a deck and ramp for the end of their semi trailer that
I hope to build (with much help - interested? -
write me!
) this fall.

I advise
Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity, Tau Chapter
and
Theta Tau Engineering Professional Fraternity, Zeta Gamma Chapter
as well as the UF Aikido Club.
