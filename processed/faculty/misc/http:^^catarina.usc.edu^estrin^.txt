Deborah Estrin is currently an Associate Professor of Computer Science
at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles where she joined
the faculty in 1986.  She received her Ph.D.
(1985) in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, her M.S. (1982) from M.I.T. and her B.S.
(1980) from U.C.  Berkeley.  In 1987, Estrin received the National
Science Foundation, Presidential Young Investigator Award for her
research in network interconnection and security.
Her research focuses on the design of
network and routing protocols for very large, global, networks.
Current research projects are in scalable multicast routing
protocols, multicast-oriented reservation setup protocols,
inter-domain routing for global internets, adaptive routing to support
multimedia applications, and design tools and techniques for
developing scalable network protocols.
Estrin is a co-PI on the NSF Routing Arbiter project. She
co-chairs the Source Demand Routing Working Group of the IETF
and is a primary participant in the Inter-Domain Multicast Routing and
RSVP working groups.
Estrin is a member of the ACM, IEEE, and AAAS. She has served on
several panels for the NSF, National Academy of Sciences/CSTB, ARPA, and
Office of Technology Assessment.  From 1988 to 1992 Estrin was one of
the founding Editors of Wiley's Journal of Internetworking Research
and Experience and is currently an editor for the ACM/IEEE
Transactions on Networks.
