Tim Davis
I'm a faculty member (Associate Professor) in the
Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department
, at the
University of Florida
.
(If you don't recognize the picture ... I haven't had the beard since '91
or so, and I no longer wear contact lenses).

COP 4600: Operating Systems (Fall '96):
NOTICE:  PROJECT 2 DEADLINE EXTENDED
(Nov 19 is +10%, Nov 21 is +5%, regular deadline now Nov 26).



Solution to mid-term exam.


Chapters & Sections from the two books, covered by
the midterm.


Tariq Masood's home page (TA for COP4600)
(will) contain a list of frequently-asked-questions about
projects, and other course-related information.

Previous semeester exams, and final, with solutions.
Note that diagrams are missing (hand-drawn).  Please see
the solutions on reserve in Marston Sci. Library for the
diagrams.

Project 1, due OCTOBER 22 (note the extension).


Project 2, assign October 31,
due November 19.


Minix 1.7.4 User Guide for COP 4600


README file on how to obtain Minix 1.7.4
(changes to User Guide, above)


ftp-accessible directory containing the Minix distribution
Be careful downloading the files in this directory using
Netscape.  They are binary files and should be downloaded
using ftp, in binary mode.

A copy of the Minix root directory.
Scan through this to see the source code for Minix,
without having to boot Minix itself.
If you have a CISE account, then cd to
~davis/Minix1.7.4/MinixRoot to see the same thing
(allows you to "grep" the source code, see the
MinixRoot README file
for more information).
Most of the stuff is in the usr/ subdirectory.
The rest is currently empty.


Technical Reports and lists of abstracts:



my own technical reports, and related reports of my students
and colleagues.


CIS technical reports.



*** (still under construction) *** Web-aware sparse matrix collection:


I maintain a large collection of
sparse test matrices.
Each matrix has its own web page, with statistical
information on the matrices and a small picture of
the nonzero pattern.
Click here for sparse matrices and patterns.
Also available via
ftp.
Other useful collections of sparse matrices include the
Harwell/Boeing collection
and the
SPARSKIT2
collection of
sparse matrices.
Our web site gives you static pictures of sparse matrices - the advantage being
that you don't have to download the whole matrix.
A dynamic viewer (assuming that you have the matrix) can give more
information.  The
Emily
package is one such example.


The Approximate Minimum Degree ordering algorithm (AMD):


********* Now released (Jan. 18, 1996) **********


AMD will appear as MC47 in Release 12 of the Harwell Subroutine Library.
Related AMD variants (not AMD itself, however) are available for non-commercial
use in
NETLIB
and via
anonymous ftp at this site
.
Take a look at my technical report lists for more information, or
click
here
for a set of transparencies from a talk given at the
International Linear Algebra Year, Direct Methods Workshop,
September 1995, hosted by
CERFACS
in Toulouse, France.
Or, click
here
for a one-page abstract of the talk.
For papers related to the talk, see
"An approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm"
and
"A combined unifrontal/multifrontal method for
unsymmetric sparse matrices."


UMFPACK: a package for solving sparse linear systems:


********* Version 2.0 is now released! (Sept. 13, 1995) **********



********* Version 2.1(Beta) is also released (Dec. 7, 1995) **********

See T. A. Davis and I. S. Duff,
"A combined unifrontal/multifrontal method for unsymmetric
sparse matrices",
TR-95-020, Submitted to ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software,
for more information.
The Unsymmetric-pattern MultiFrontal Package
(UMFPACK, Version 2.0)
solves the linear system
Ax
=
b
using LU factorization, where
A
is a general unsymmetric sparse matrix.
The method relies on dense matrix kernels
(the BLAS, also see below)
to factorize
rectangular frontal matrices, which are dense submatrices of the sparse
matrix being factorized.  As a result, it obtains high performance
on RISC-based workstations and vector supercomputers.
The package includes a
Users' Guide
and both
double and single precision versions.  It requires
the BLAS,
and two subroutines from the
Harwell MA28 code
(MC21B and MC13E, available from NETLIB).
UMFPACK is freely available for research purposes.  For commercial use,
UMFPACK Version 2.0 will soon appear as MA38 be placed in the
Harwell Subroutine Library.
UMFPACK is written in ANSI Fortran 77.

A Beta release of
UMFPACK Version 2.1
is now available (only by ftp, not in NETLIB).
The primary difference with Version 2.0 is that COMPLEX and COMPLEX*16
versions are included in UMFPACK Version 2.1.
If you use the Beta release, please let me know (whether or not you
encounter any bugs).  I'll submit the final release of Version 2.1 once
the Beta release is tested in a real application.  My test suite of complex
matrices is rather limited.
Note that the complex versions will not appear in the next
release of the Harwell Subroutine Library (for which
January 1996 is the target date).
This work is in collaboration with
Iain Duff,
Group Leader of the
Numerical Analysis Group
of the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, England,
and
The European Centre for Research and Advanced Training in
Scientific Computation (CERFACS).


UMFPACK Version 2.0
is also in NETLIB.  UMFPACK Versions 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer available,
nor supported.

The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms):


The
Fortran BLAS in NETLIB
is a "model implementation."  For best performance
of UMFPACK, you should use vendor-optimized BLAS.  Alternatively, an
excellent optimized BLAS for RISC workstations is available from Michel
Dayde, Iain Duff, Antoine Petitet, and Abderrahim Qrichi Aniba.
In my experiments on a Sparc 20 Model 41, this optimized BLAS is up to
four times faster than the non-optimized BLAS available in NETLIB.
You can get the most recent version via
anonymous ftp to ENSEEIHT, France
.
However, since the trans-Atlantic link can be slow, I've placed
a copy (with the authors' permission) at this
Univ. of Florida site
.
Note that the UF copy might not be the most
recent, although I will try to keep it up-to-date.  Click
here
for more information about the optimized BLAS.


FLOODS/FLOOPS: Florida Object Oriented Device/Process Simulators:


UMFPACK has been incorporated as the primary sparse factorization code in the
FLOODS and FLOOPS
packages for semiconductor device and process simulation.
The two packages are written by
Mark Law
in the
VLSI/TCAD Group
of the
Electrical Engingeering Department
of the
University of Florida
.
