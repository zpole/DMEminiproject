Research
Dr. Stallmann's research interests are primarily in the area of combinational
optimization, graph and network algorithms, with emphasis on settling the
status of problems that are on the boundary between tractable and intractable
(NP-complete).  Current projects include (a) embedding graphs into hypercubes,
(b) planar embedding problems related to VLSI design, (c) combinational
algorithms on linear arrays of processors, and (d) a system for graphical input
to and animation of graph algorithms (source code and
documentation for an algorithm animation tool,
GDR
, are available
here).

Task Group on Peer Evaluation of Teaching



Guidelines for peer evaluation of teaching

general guidelines for peer evaluation of teaching that were
adopted as departmental policy in March, 1995.

Guidelines for in-class evaluation of teaching

proposed guidelines for evaluators who visit the classroom of a
colleague (still being reviewed and amended in response to faculty
input).
