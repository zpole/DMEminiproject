Research Interests

My primary research interest is in robotics, particularly in mobile
robotics.  In the Tulane EECS Robotics Laboratory (lab home page
forthcoming), we are performing distributed manipulation tasks with
several mobile robots.

Courses (1996-97)

CPSC 319 Symbolic Computing (link available only locally)

CPSC 350 Programming Languages

Robotics Seminar


Coming Soon

Our robotics research is proceeding with the help of many talented
students and colleagues, and credits and pointers to their pages
will appear here in the future.
