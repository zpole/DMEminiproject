Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley

Research Interests:
Design
and analysis of algorithms, theory of computation, computational complexity,
parallel computing, and VLSI computation.
Oscar H. Ibarra received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering
from the University of the Philippines in 1962 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees,
also in Electrical Engineering, from the University of California, Berkeley,
in 1965 and 1967, respectively.  He is currently a Professor of Computer
Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  He has previously
been with the faculties of UC Berkeley (1967-1969) and the University of
Minnesota (1969-1990).
Dr. Ibarra's research interests include the design
and analysis of algorithms, theory of computation, computational complexity,
parallel computing, and VLSI computation.  Professor Ibarra was awarded a
Guggenheim Fellowship in 1984 for his work in systolic systems.  He is a
Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),  the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the American Association
for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the Minnesota Supercomputer
Institute. Dr. Ibarra is a member of the IEEE Computer Society, the ACM
Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory, the Society
for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the European Association for
Theoretical Computer Science.
Dr. Ibarra is on the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Computers,
IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, Journal of
Parallel and Distributed Computing, Theoretical Computer Science,
International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science, Journal
of VLSI Signal Processing, and Journal of Computing and Information.
He is on the advisory board of the Parallel
Computing Book Series for Chapman and Hall.
