Away on sabbatical FALL 1996 at Oxford University, England.
My research is strongly interdisciplinary.  It concerns using neural
networks as a computational model applied to problems in cognitive science
and artificial intelligence, engineering and biology. I have had success
using them for such disparate tasks as modeling how children acquire words,
studying how lobsters chew, and nonlinear data compression.
I was Program Chair for the
1996 Cognitive Science Conference.

My research group,

Gary and Eric's Unbelievable Research Unit

or
GEURU
(pronounced like "neuron", shortened) for short,
meets weekly to present our work to one another.
I try to give my students mantras, like "One result, one paper"
in keeping with
the name. But I claim no special knowledge.
Here's my
