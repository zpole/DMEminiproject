My interests are in access methods, on-line reorganization, clustering,
workflow and warehousing.
For some papers and code on the hB-Pi tree, a
multiattribute point access method with a NODE CONSOLIDATION ALGORITHM
and support for concurrency and recovery, click here:
The hB-Pi tree
.
A short version of this work appeared in the 1995 VLDB Conference in
Zurich.
The version of this work accepted for publication in the VLDB
Journal is in
VLDB
Journal Article
.

The hB-Pi tree is insensitive to increase in dimensions. This makes
it particularly useful in data warehousing where many different
attributes are needed for study of patterns in data. There seems to
be a growing interest in this work as multi-dimensional data becomes
impossible to store in array form when the number of dimensions and
the volume of data is large.
This is work done with Georgios Evangelidis and David Lomet.
Georgios is currently in the Greek army, but can be reached at
giorgos@tsolias.civil.auth.gr.
For papers on hierarchical clustering and on-line reorganization,
click on
Clustering
.
This is work with Chendong Zou. The hierarchical clustering paper is
also in collaboration with Rivka Ladin.
We have developed an
encoding for hierarchical structures so that they can be stored
and retrieved efficiently in a single primary B+-tree. Zou and I have also
developed an algorithm for consolidated
sparse B+-trees (Sigmod 96)
and updated references to moved records.
For (1) a survey paper on temporal access methods written with Vassilis
Tsotras (accepted for publication in Computing Surveys),
(2) a paper on timestamping published in PDIS 94,
(3) a paper on my personal experiences, errors and wanderings ("On Indexing
Spatial and Temporal Data") (appeared in Information Systems),
(4) a paper on workflow ("DSDT: Durable Scripts
containing Database Transactions") written with Dimitri Tombroff (ICDE 96) and
(5) a paper on warehousing written with Andreas Reuter, click here:

I am currently an associate editor of the IEEE Computer Society
Data Engineering Bulletin

I am a member of the
1997 VLDB Program Committee.


College of Computer Science Colloquium

I am the Colloquium chair. For the Colloquium schedule and the abstract

Colloquium


My schedule
Teaching at NU this Fall, and in Winter, Spring and Summer 1997.
I will teach one graduate course in databases each quarter and one
undergraduate course in the Winter and in the Summer. I will spend
some time in Europe in Fall 1997.
