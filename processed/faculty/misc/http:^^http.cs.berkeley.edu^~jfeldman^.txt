Current Research Projects


One major project is the
Sather
language, compiler, libraries and system. My personal work is focusing
on the parallel extension which we call pSather.

The other major current project is the
L0
effort in natural
language learning.


Students



David
Bailey

interpretation of verb phrases describing simple hand actions.


Chris Bregler
is a grad. student in computer science interested in
computer vision, speech recognition, and the relation of both.

Ben Gomes

Srinivas Narayanan

Jonathan Segal


David Stoutamire
maintains the
Sather
and pSather language spec and compiler.  His thesis topic is exploiting
garbage collection to implement dynamic object-based locality
