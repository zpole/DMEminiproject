Alan D. Christiansen


Assistant Professor

Director, Graduate Studies
Director, Robotics and Automation Program






I'm interested in autonomous systems (agents) for design automation,
manufacturing, education, and internet-based commerce.  The
enabling technologies supporting these interests include machine learning,
automated planning, computer graphics, user interface design, and the
world-wide web.
If you are interested, I have written down some ideas for honors/master's
projects
.
My most recent paper is
Automated Design of Part Feeders using a Genetic Algorithm
.

the unreasonable one persists in adapting the world to himself.
Therefore, all progress depends upon the unreasonable man."
