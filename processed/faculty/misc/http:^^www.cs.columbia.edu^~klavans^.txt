Research Interests

My research lies in computational linguistics and natural language
processing.  I am currently working on ways to represent meaning from
texts and to link meaningful segments via semantic nets.  I have been
involved in the Text Encoding Initiative, an SGML based set of
guidelines for indepth text representation, which has led me to be
interested in mark-up languages in general.  I am also working on ways
to automatically determine lexical information via statistical means
over parsed texts.  Prior to arriving at Columbia, I spent nearly ten
years at the TJ Waston IBM Research Division, where I worked on
extracting information from machine-readable dictionaries.  I have
also worked on speech synthesis and text-to-speech systems.
The kinds of systems that have used the results of my research have
been: natural language parsers, machine translation systems, and text
critiquing systems.
