Biographical Sketch
I am a Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta
(Edmonton, Canada) where I lead research groups in distributed
object management, focusing on the development of
TIGUKAT
Objectbase Management System,
multimedia
data management
, with special emphasis on the development of
multimedia DBMSs that can support the SGML/HyTime standard,
image
database management
, concentrating on the development of a
distributed, interoperable image database system, and
interoperability of information systems in general.
I joined the department in 1984 after receiving, in 1983, my Ph.D.  in
computer and information science from The Ohio State University. Prior
to my academic career, I have spent a number of years in industry and
government (in Turkey). I spent my study leave during 1990-91 at GTE
Laboratories (Waltham, Massachusetts) as a visiting scientist working
on distributed object management issues.
I have authored one book, co-authored a second book
and co-edited two books. I serve on the editorial boards of The VLDB
Journal (VLDB Foundation), Distributed and Parallel Databases (Kluwer
Publishers), and Parallel and Distributed Technology (IEEE Computer
Society). I have presented technical tutorials at a number of
international conferences (Very Large Data Base, Data Engineering,
COMPCON, Reliable Distributed Systems, CIKM, and Parallel and
Distributed Processing) in addition to tutorials and short courses for
companies and other institutions in Canada, USA, Mexico and Europe. I
have served on a large number of conference program and organizing
committees and have chaired a few.
I chaired the Computer and Information Science Grant Selection
Committee of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada during 1993-94 and served as the member of the same Committee
from 1991 to 1993. I served on the Management Committee of the
Canadian Genome Analysis and Technology Program during 1992-93. I
held the University of Alberta McCalla Research Professorship for
1993-94 and was Acting Chair of the Department of Computing Science
during 1994-95.
