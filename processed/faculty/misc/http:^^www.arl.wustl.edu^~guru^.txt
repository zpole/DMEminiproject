SUMMARY




Axon High
Performance Host--Network Interface Architecture

Axon is a high performance host--network interface architecture that
was designed and extensively simulated at Washington University in
St. Louis from 1988 through 1992, encompassing host and network
interface architecture, operating systems, and protocols.
We beleive Axon to be the first zero-copy host network interface, and
the first use of distributed virtual shared memory over a wide area
network.

The Next Generation Internetworking

During 1987-92,  my students and I worked on a research project
concerned with the design of the next generation of internet
architecture. (If you are interested in RSVP and Integrated Services
work in IETF, you should look at our earlier work.)  Important aspects
of this project include:
Design, specification, and prototype implementation of a novel
multipoint "congram-oriented" service
that can work well with
connection-oriented and datagram high speed networks, can provide
variable grade service on a need basis to its applications, and can
provide adequate reconfigurability to deal with survivability
requirements due to network failures. For details on a prototype
implementation, check this paper out on
COIP-K
.
Design and implementation of gateway architectures that can support
data rates of a few hundred Mbps, can interface with diverse networks,
and can implement the congram-oriented service without becoming a
performance bottleneck.  For details on our work on a ATM-FDDI
gateway, click

.
Development of analytical and simulation models to evaluate
important tradeoffs associated with the design of a congram-oriented
protocol, the resource management on diverse networks, and the design
of new gateway architectures.

FAVORITE QUOTES


Admiration: Our polite recognition of another's resemblance to
ourselves.
For students (especially when a project deadline approaches):
Don't tell me how hard you work, tell me how much you get done.
Sign of arrogance: My opinions may have changed but not the fact
that I am right.
A model is an artifice for helping you convince yourself that you
understand more about a system than you do.
A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a
person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as
possible.  Freeman Dyson, Disturbing the Universe (To help keep my role in
CCRC and ARL in perspective)
If feature "F" is a good thing then so is "distributed F", and
vice-versa [if not today, maybe in five years] Tom Truscott (com.os.research)
