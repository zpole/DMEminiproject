Current work focusses on the development of
Filaments
, a software package that provides efficent fine-grain
parallelism on a variety of parallel machines.
He has written two books published by Benjamin/Cummings:
Concurrent Programming:  Principles and Practice
(1991) and
The SR Programming Language:  Concurrency in Practice
(1993, with Ron Olsson).
When he's not in the department or at home,
Greg can usually be found at some golf course.
He keeps trying to get ready for the PGA Senior Tour, but his
"friends" tell him the tour already has enough caddies.
