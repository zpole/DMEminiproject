I'm the Associate Chair of the University of Florida's
Computer & Information Science & Engineering Department
.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
University of Virginia
Department of Computer Science
in 1985.
My interests lie in Programming Languages, Computer Vision,
and the boundary where these two areas of study meet.




Image Algebra

Nowadays I'm most closely associated with the Image Algebra Project.
The goal of this project is the development of a formal mathematical
notation well-suited to the expression of image-processing and
computer-vision algorithms.  This has led to numerous mathematical
results as well as the development of the image algebra C++ class
library (iac++).

Gerhard Ritter
and I
have written the
Handbook of Computer
Vision Algorithms in Image Algebra
. It is in
publication with CRC Press.
It contains a brief introduction to image algebra and
shows how it can be applied by specifying over 80 computer
vision and image processing algorithms.


Administrivia

I have a small collection of CIS Department and University of
Florida administrative information.

Marlais Dylan Interpreter

I maintain the Marlais interpreter.
This is a freely available interpreter for a language approximating
Apple Computer's dynamic object-oriented programming language
Dylan
.

Image Algebra Course

During the fall semester of 1996, I am teaching a course on
Image Algebra (CAP 6418 sec. 4694X).

Object-Oriented Programming

During the spring semester of 1996, I am teaching an Object-Oriented
Programming (CIS 4930 sec. 0998X).

Facilities and Equipment Committee

I maintain some information about the Department Facilities and
Equipment Committee.

1994-95 TIP Award Portfolio

I was selected for a 1994-95 TIP award.  My application portfolio is
available for browsing.

Old Image Algebra Course

During the spring semester of 1995 I taught a course
on Image Algebra (CIS 6930 Section 0942V).

Old OOP Course Info

During the spring semester of 1995, I taught an Object-Oriented
Programming (CIS 4930 sec. 0939X).

Computers & Vision

During the fall semester of 1994 I taught
Computers and Vision (CAP 6416).
