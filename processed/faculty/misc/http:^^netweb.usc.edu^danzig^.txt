Peter B. Danzig joined the University of Southern California as an
Assistant Professor of Computer Science in January, 1990.  He received
his B.S. in Applied Physics from University of California Davis and his
Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California Berkeley,
studying under Professor Domencio Ferrari.  He received an NSF
NYI
award in
1994 and USC Innovative Teaching Awards both in 1992-3 for creating
an undergraduate class in simulation techniques and in 1993-4 for
updating his laboratory class in computer networks and distributed systems. His
research focuses on packet network and distributed system performance
and Internet information systems.  Danzig is a collaborator on the
Harvest Information Discovery
System
.  Danzig is
on an Associate Editor for the Journal of Internetworking Research
and Experience.
