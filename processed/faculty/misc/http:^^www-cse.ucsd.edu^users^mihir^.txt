Recent research and publications
I work in the following areas--


Cryptography:
You can find
papers
and a
research summary
.


Complexity theory:
(Probabilistic proofs and approximation,
interactive proofs, randomness.)  You can find
papers and surveys
and a
research summary
.


Other:
(Computationl learning theory, distributed computing.)
You can find
papers
and a
research summary
.

I have only listed work from 1992 onwards. If you want an earlier
paper, please contact me.

Biographical sketch
Mihir received his BS (in Mathematics) from the
California Institute of Technology
in
1986, and his Ph.D (in Computer Science) from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in
1991. From 1991 to 1995 he was at the
IBM T.J. Watson Research Center
,
Hawthorne, New York, working in network security and complexity
theory.  He joined the
Computer Science
and Engineering Department
of the
University of California at San Diego
in October 1995 as
Assistant Professor.
