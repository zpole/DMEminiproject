I am a research assistant professor working with the
Center for Intelligent Information
Retrieval
(CIIR).  My current work focuses on these areas:

tools for browsing collections of documents
relevance feedback techniques
combining structural information about documents with textual
information in order to improve quality of retrieval.  This is joint
work with
Daniela
Rus
at the
Dartmouth
College's Department of Computer Science
.
A list of my papers, including on-line copies of many of them, is
available
here
.
I got the Ph.D. in January, 1995, from
Cornell University
's
Computer Science Department
.  My
advisor was the late
Gerard
Salton
(1927-1995).  My thesis was on the automatic construction
of hypertext links.
I am guest co-editor of a special topic issue of
Information
Processing and Management
on the tools for the automatic
construction of hypertext and hypermedia.  For more details, see the
call for papers
.
On an on-going basis, I am running a research group meeting called
Topics in Information Retrieval
.  It is
also a seminar which students can take.
In the old days, I played
ice
hockey with Cornell's CS department
.
At Cornell, I worked with the Smart system Information Retrieval
group.  I also participated in discussions with the
Information
Capture and Access research group
.
