Look

for a "comprehensive" list of AI pages on the web.

If you're in to one stop shopping Carnegie Mellon's
Artificial Intelligence Repository
is probably the overall best place on the web.
Two sections of CMU's repository that are helpful for this course:
An html copy of
Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition

and their
Lisp
and
Prolog
repositories.
