Welcome to my home page





I joined McGill University in 1987, and  established
the Advanced Computer Architecture and Program
Structures Group (ACAPS) along with few of my graduate students.
In December 1992, it was renamed to
Advanced Compilers,
Architecture, and Parallel Systems (ACAPS)
group, after the
arrival of Prof. L. Hendren and P. Panaganden, and the rapid
expansion of the group's research interest and areas.
The
ACAPS
lab now  consists of 4 faculty members,  3 post-doctoral research fellows,
and a number of  Doctoral and Masters' students. Within the lab, there
are a number of exciting
research  projects.
