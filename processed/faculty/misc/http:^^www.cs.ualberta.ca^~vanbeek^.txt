Biographical sketch

I received my PhD in 1990 from the University of Waterloo and
at that time joined the faculty at the University of Alberta
where I am now an Associate Professor.
I am a participant as a principal investigator in projects on
intelligent scheduling and on speech understanding under the
Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IRIS II).
I have served on the program committees of several international
conferences and workshops.
In 1992, a paper I wrote was awarded honorable mention in
the best written paper competition at the National Conference of
the American Association for Artificial Intelligence.
In 1995, a paper I co-authored won an Outstanding Paper
Award at the International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence.
