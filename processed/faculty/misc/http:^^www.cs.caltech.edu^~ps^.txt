Java for Wavelets
Java is still a bit painful, but it provides extraordinary potential
for use in research and teaching. Here is a small collection of
subdivision and wavelet related applets that students, collaborators,
and I myself have written. Check them out!

A simple demonstration of how to draw smooth curves through
corner cutting
(and my first
attempt at Java...). This is an instance of subdivision which is
intricately linked to wavelet constructions.
One of the students in CS274b, Dmitri Linde, took this applet
as a starting point for his
homework
assignment. It demonstrates B-splines and Bezier curves of
varying order and lenght all rolled into one application. They
are all generated through subdivision.
Dmitri Linde also implemented his
CS274b project
in Java. AWESOME!
Wim Sweldens wrote a little applet that allows you to explore
the space of all
four tap wavelets
.
Watch this space for more to come as
Mike Astle
and Dae Kang start hacking Java this summer!

Research Interests
My main interest right now is in
multi level methods
. So far
this has been happening under the headline of
wavelets
, but we
are generalizing the ideas more and more, so whether it should still
be called wavelets is up to debate. An overview of
research projects
in the computer graphics
group as a whole gives some more ideas about concrete projects that
are happening or about to happen.

Publications
Almost everything is available online but not all of it in fancy html
yet. Here are a few


Wavelets in Computer
Graphics
course notes for
Siggraph 96 (with Wim Sweldens,
Michael Cohen, Tony DeRose, and David Salesin). The
first two chapters
are the
latest (and much improved...) guide to
``Building Your Own
Wavelets at Home.''


Interpolating Subdivision for Meshes with
Arbitrary Topology
(with Denis Zorin and Wim Sweldens),
CS-TR-96-6. Final Siggraph
version
and some
cool pix:
Mannequin
,
Tetrahedron
,
Pipes
, and
Venus
(David coming soon...)

Wavelets in Computer
Graphics
, to appear in a special issue of the
Proceedings of the IEEE
.

Spherical Wavelets: Efficiently
Representing Functions on the Sphere
(with Wim
Sweldens), appeared in
Proceedings of Siggraph 95
.

Spherical Wavelets: Texture Processing
(with Wim Sweldens), appeared in
Rendering Techniques

Wavelet Image Compression
appeared in
Wired Magazine

On the Formfactor between
Two Polygons
(with Pat Hanrahan), appeared in
Proceedings of Siggraph 93
. There is also a
TR
version which gives all the
gory details,
Mathematica Code
,
and even a
C library
which
implements the form factor expression (of course without any
guarantees that it will always work...).

Building Your Own Wavelets at

Proceedings of ACM Volume Visualization Workshop
, 1992.
I have also contributed to the Siggraph notes for the
Wavelets in Computer Graphics
course held at Siggraph 95, Los Angeles.
