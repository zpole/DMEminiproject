I am a
faculty
member
in the
Department of Computer Science
at the
University of Saskatchewan
.

My area of academic research is ``uncertainty in
artificial intelligence''.   For more than a decade,
I have been interested in the application of probability theory to
problems in Artificial Intelligence traditionally handled by logics,
grammars and heuristics.  In AI's earliest days, it was widely held
that complexity problems and the unavailability of meaningful
probability distributions made this impractical.  In the last decade,
this opinion has changed.   Two major
international conferences, one organized by
the Association for Uncertainty
in AI
and one organized by
the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Statistics
,
discuss probabilistic and statistical AI, and
statistical approaches to AI problems have entered the AI
mainstream.

Together with colleagues and students, I have looked at
probabilistic approaches to default inference, diagnosis, temporal
reasoning, natural language, and classification. My work appears
in major journals and several
national and international workshops and conferences.  I have also
edited a special issue of
Computational Intelligence
journal on the
philosophy of nonmonotonic reasoning, featuring a target article by
Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.
.
