I
am a Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at U C San Diego and
Senior Fellow at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
My research focuses on the development of models and software
for scheduling parallel applications on distributed heterogeneous resources.
In addition, I am interested in
parallel programming models and environments.
Distributed heterogeneous computing, our main focus area, is the coordinated use of networked
resources for large-scale parallel applications.
My students and I are involved in building
models, tools and software to promote the efficient scheduling
and implementation
of high-performance applications on distributed heterogeneous platforms.
