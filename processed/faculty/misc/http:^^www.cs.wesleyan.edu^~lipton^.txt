Has lots of stuff of interest to
potential grad studentss, in particular a link to a NRC study ranking 108
schools in 20 different areas.
= a link via princeton, to lots of CS depts

Some quotes taken from the student net at Wesleyan...


"More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single
reason - including blind stupidity."
W.A. Wulf

"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil."
Donald Knuth

"The best is the enemy of the good."
Voltaire
