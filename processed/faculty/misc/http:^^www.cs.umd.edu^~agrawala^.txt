Research Interests:


Design and Evaluation of Systems and Networks


Principal Investigator for the
Maruti Project


The major thrust of my research over the last few years has been to
understand the role of time in the design and implementation of computer
systems.  I am examining the issues of representation, management and
manipulation of time in systems.  One context of this study is the design
and implementation of the advanced hard real-time which we are
undertaking in the MARUTI project.  The goal of the MARUTI project is to
create an environment for the development and deployment of applications
with hard real-time systems, fault tolerance, and security requirements.
Such applications must be able to execute on a distributed, heterogeneous
hardware base.  During the past five years, we have created a framework
for such an environment and have demonstrated the feasibilty of the
design through implementations of the prototype of the MARUTI Environment.
