Jessica Hodgins

Assistant Professor,

College of Computing






Jessica Hodgins
is an Assistant Professor in the College of Computing.
She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from
Carnegie Mellon University
in 1989 and was a postdoctoral fellow in the
the Leg Lab
at the
MIT Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory
and the
IBM Thomas J. Watson Research
Center
.
Her graduate research involved programming a two-legged laboratory robot
to
run, accurately place its foot to avoid obstacles, climb stairs and
perform
gymnastic maneuvers. Her research focuses on the
coordination and control of dynamic physical systems, both natural and
human-made and explores techniques that may someday allow robots and
animated creatures to plan and control their actions in complex and
unpredictable environments.
Her current research focuses
on generating motion for
computer animation
by using control algorithms in
combination with physically realistic simulation.
Her recent research funding is from the
National Science
Foundation
and
Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory
.
She was awarded an
NSF Young Investigator Award
and the
Packard Foundation Fellowship
in
Science and Engineering in 1994, and a
Sloan Foundation
Fellowship
in 1995.
