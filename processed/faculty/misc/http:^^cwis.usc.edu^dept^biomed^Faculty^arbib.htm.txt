Michael A. Arbib, Ph.D.







Michael A. Arbib

Professor

Dr. Arbib currently directs a major interdisciplinary project on "Neural Plasticity: Data and Computational Structures", which is integrating studies of learning and neural compensation for disease with research on tools for multi-media database construction, data recovery, visualization and multi-level simulation.
His own research focusses on mechanisms underlying the coordination of perception and action. This is tackled at two levels: via schema theory, which is applicable both in top-down analyses of brain function and human cognition as well as in studies of machine vision and robotics; and through the detailed analysis of neural networks, working closely with the experimental findings of neuroscientists.
The author of 20 books and the editor of 11 more, Dr. Arbib has most recently edited "The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks", a massive compendium embracing studies in detailed neuronal function, systems models of brain regions, connectionist models of psychology and linguistics, mathematical and biological studies of learning, and technological applications of artificial neural networks.
