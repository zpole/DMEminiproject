Barak Pearlmutter,
PhD


Professional

Interests
Neural Networks, how the brain works, machine learning, neuroscience,
programming language design and implementation.  I have a short
demo page,
and a nascent collection of
contributed code.


Employment
I'm an associate professor in the
Computer Science Department
at the
University of New Mexico
in
Albuquerque
.  However this semester
I'm a visiting the
Cognitive Science
Department
at
UCSD
.
Publications
The communal memory of science.
Editing
I'm an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks.  If
you are reviewing a paper, I wrote a
page
you might find interesting.

Political
If you oppose trivial software patents and the barriers they raise
to entry into the software market, you should join
the League for Programming Freedom,
as I have.



For more information about the Communications Decency Act (currently
struck down by a lower court, a status which is being appealed to the
Supreme Court by the Justice Department), a heinous assault on your
freedom of speech, see what the organizations that support your
electronic freedom have to say:
the Center for Democracy and
Technology
,
the Electronic Frontier
Foundation
, and
the Electronic Privacy
Information Center
.

Artistic

Automotive

Our ocularly dominant
automobile, shown here behind
Harvard
's
William James Hall
in the final
stages of painting, is part of
Jim
Muller's art car caravan.
The central portion of the hood is
copied from Nobel laureates Hubel and Weisel's influential work on
occular dominance columns in cat striate cortex.
This lovely art car is in New Jersey.  It costs $300 to import a
car into California, so our creation is
for sale.
Ya wanna buy?
Talk
to me
, baby.

Ceramic
My ceramic art combines wheel thrown techniques and hand building to
play at the ago old tension in pottery between doing something and
saying something.
