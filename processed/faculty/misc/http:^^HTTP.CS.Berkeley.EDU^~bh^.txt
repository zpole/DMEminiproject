HomePage for Brian Harvey (bh@cs.Berkeley.EDU)



I teach many of the lower division (freshman and sophomore)
computer science courses
at Berkeley.  I'm faculty advisor of the
Computer Science
Undergraduate Association
and of the
Open Computing Facility
.
I'm also interested in the use of computers in
pre-college education; I used to be a
high school
teacher, and I'm involved in the development of the Logo programming
language.
Berkeley Logo
is a freeware interpreter that I wrote along with
several students.  (Major contributors are Dan van Blerkom,
Michael Katz, and Doug Orleans.)  Click here to retrieve
the
complete distribution
archive for
Unix
,
DOS
, or
Mac
,
complete with C source code.  (If you think Logo is just a graphics
language for little kids, check out a
sample program
that should impress you.)





Intermediate Programming
,
a Logo programming text that concentrates on natural language
processing rather than the graphics most people associate with Logo.
Projects, Styles, and Techniques
,
a collection of ten largeish Logo programs with commentary on the
structure and style of each.
Advanced Topics
,
brief introductions to six college-level computer science topics.

The
Computer Science Logo Style
books are out of print,
but you can order a bound photocopy from
MIT Document Services
.  The second edition should be published
early in 1997.

I've written several
papers about
computers and education
.
I'm a member of
Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility
,
the League for Programming Freedom
, and
the
American Civil Liberties Union
.
So, what do you do for fun, Brian?


I visit the
Exploratorium
,
the world's best museum.
I watch the
Animaniacs
, the only good thing on television.
I listen to 1964-1968 British rock, especially the
Beatles
.
I eat
Chinese
food
.
I collect
art
and
masks
.  (Lots of bits in these links.)

stuffing recipe
