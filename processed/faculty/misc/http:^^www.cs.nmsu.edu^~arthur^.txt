Current Experimental Efforts
We are currently conducting experiments involving the use of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by non-sighted computer users. We have developed two test environments that allow the non-sighted user to navigate through complex menu structures and the visual desktop with the aid of musical tones and synthesized voice.  The test environments currently run on Macs in the CS Department's labs.
We are always looking for volunteers to test the intefaces concepts.
