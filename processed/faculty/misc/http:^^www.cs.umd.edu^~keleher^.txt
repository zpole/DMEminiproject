M
achine
(CVM)
:
A flexible
architecture for implementing distributed shared memroy protocols. The CVM
project was established with the goal of investigating novel protocols,
multi-threading support, and extensibility. (

Active Harmony
:

Active Harmony
is a software architecture that supports efficient
distributed execution of computational objects in dynamic environments
through
runtime adaptation
,
automatic application
adaptation
, and novel
shared-data interfaces
.



TreadMarks
:
My dissertation research centered on developing memory models that allow
high performance DSM implementations over networks of workstations. This
research resulted in the definition of
Lazy Release Consistency
, and
the design and implementation of TreadMarks.
