Research Interests:
Parallel computing, parallel programming
tools and systems, scheduling and compilation, scientific computing
and digitial libraries.
Tao Yang received the B.S. degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University,
China, in 1984,  the M.E. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Zhejiang
University in 1987. He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
in Computer Science  from Rutgers University in 1990 and 1993.
He joined the Department of Computer Science at UCSB in 1993 as an
Assistant Professor.
Dr. Yang is a member of the Parallel Systems Group at UCSB. His main
research interests are
algorithms and programming environments for parallel and distributed processing,
program scheduling and compilation,  and parallel scientific computing.
He has proposed efficient scheduling algorithms and
developed a parallel programming system for exploring task parallelism on
message-passing machines, and applied this system in scientific computing.
He has also conducted the research on parallel numerical algorithms and
knowledge-based systems. Dr. Yang is currently investigating the
partitioning and scheduling methods and systems for program parallelization,
irregular sparse matrix computations and WWW/digital libraries.
Dr. Yang is a PC member and the tutorials chair for
IPPS'97
(11th Inernational Parallel Processing Symposium)
,
a PC member and local organizer of
Irregular'96
(Third International Workshop on
Parallel Algorithms for Irregularly Structured Problems)
,
a PC member of
Euro-Par'96
for
Workshop #17 on
Scheduling and Load Balancing
,
the Second Workshop on Solving Irregular Problems on
Distributed Memory Machines in
IPPS 96
,
the 8th IEEE Symposium on Parallel and
Distributed Processing
in 1996, and
the 3rd International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC)
.
He is a coordinator for minitrack "Partitioning and
Scheduling" in the
28th
and
29th
Hawaii International Conference
on System Sciences.  He is the
local arrangements and registration co-chair for the
ACM PPoPP (Symposium on Principle and Practice of Parallel Programming)
and ACM SPAA (Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures) in 1995.
Dr. Yang is  on the editorial boards of
Journal Discrete Mathematics \& Theoretical Computer Science and the
Journal of Computing and Information, and a guest editor for a special issue
on partitioning and scheduling in Journal Parallel Processing Letters.
Dr. Yang received the Research Initiation Award from NSF in 1994,
UC Regents' Junior Faculty Award in 1994 and
the Outstanding Computer Science Professor of the Year Award in 1995.
He is  a member of ACM, IEEE, and SIAM.
