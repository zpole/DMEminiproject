Peter M. Chen

Assistant Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
University of Michigan,
I am directing the Rio (RAM I/O) project at the University of Michigan.
Rio is investigating how to use non-volatile memory (flash or battery-backed
DRAM) to store files, and to do so reliably and inexpensively.

This is a earlier tech report version of the ASPLOS paper.  The major
difference is that the ASPLOS version uses the new protection scheme
that forces all addresses through the TLB, whereas the tech report
version uses code-patching and consequently gets worse performance.
