Nathaniel G. Martin, URCS Faculty Member

b. 1955. Ph.D. (1993) University of Rochester. Instructor
(93-present), University of Rochester.
Nat Martin's primary reponsibilities in the Computer Science
Department are teaching rather than research. He teaches the
department's introductory
courses
.
His research interests are knowledge representation, planning, and
execution. In particular, he applies statistical knowledge gathered in
the course of executing plans to the problem of generating and
executing new plans. He has developed a planning assistant that
gathers information from the TRAINS world and makes decisions based on
these plans. In support of this research, he built a simulator for
this world that allows one to specify uncertain outcomes for actions.
