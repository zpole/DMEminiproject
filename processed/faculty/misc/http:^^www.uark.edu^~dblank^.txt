EACHING


This semester I am teaching
Programming
I
(C++) and
Advanced
Programming Languages
.




I
NTERESTS


I am generally interested in artificial intelligence,
cognitive science, and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested
in teaching artificial neural networks (aka, connectionist networks)
how to perform high-level cognitive tasks such as analogy-making. I
plan on forming an Artificial Intelligence Lab here at the University
of Arkansas where we will study robots, machine learning, neural
networks, and other forms of artificial intelligence. The emphasis
will be on systems capabable of learning high-level cognitive
abilities starting with nothing but low-level perceptions. I have also
been working on organizing a
Cognitive Science Program
here as
well.

If you have
ideas
,
comments
,
or
questions
, feel free to drop
me a line.
