My research concerns distributed and parallel computing systems,
particularly design issues with a performance orientation.
Check out the
DISCUS
pages for further information and recent publications.
I am an active participant in SIGMETRICS
(the
ACM
Special Interest Group on
performance evaluation),
serving on the Program Committee of the annual SIGMETRICS conference
in 1986,1989,1991,1993, and 1997, and as Program Chair in 1987.
I am currently a member of the editorial board of
IEEE
Transactions
on Software Engineering, and am in the final year of a three year term on the
NSERC
