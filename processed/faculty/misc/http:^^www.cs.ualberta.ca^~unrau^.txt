Research Interests
Networks of workstations are cheap and plentiful, and yet are seldom
exploited for their potential as parallel systems.
This is partly due to the difficulty in writing parallel programs in
a message-passing environment, and partly due to the high communication
cost over the network.
Some progress has been made through Distributed Shared Memory
systems that present a shared memory programming abstraction, and which
minimize communication using weak coherence.
Some progress has also been made through compilers that can generate
parallel code directly.
My research is aimed at extending this progress on both fronts, primarily
through parallel compilation techniques targeted to Distributed Shared
Memory environments.
This work is focused in three areas: 1) targeting to weakly coherent
systems; 2) improving locality to reduce communication; and 3) exploring
and improving the interaction between the compiler and run-time systems.
