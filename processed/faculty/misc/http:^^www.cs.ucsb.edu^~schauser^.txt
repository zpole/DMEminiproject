Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley

Research Interests:
parallel computing, functional
programming languages, compilers, computer architecture
Klaus E. Schauser received the Diplom in Computer Science from the
Universit√§t Karlsruhe in 1989 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, also
in Computer Science, from the University of California, Berkeley, in
1991 and 1994, respectively.  He joined the Computer Science
Department at UCSB as an Assistant Professor in 1994.
Professor Schauser is a member of the Parallel Computing Group at
UCSB where his main research interests are in parallel languages and
compilation and system aspects for highly parallel architectures.
While at Berkeley, he developed novel compilation techniques based on
multithreading for implementing functional programming languages on
parallel machines.
Professor Schauser is a member of the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM), the ACM Special Interest Groups in Computer
Architecture and Programming Languages, and the IEEE Computer Society.
He is the local arrangements and registration co-chair for
the
Symposium on
Parallel Algorithms and Architectures
and
Symposium on
Principles and Practices of Parallel Programming
to be held at
UCSB in July of 1995.
