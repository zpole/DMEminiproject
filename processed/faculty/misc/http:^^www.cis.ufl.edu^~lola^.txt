Every semester I teach two introduction to COBOL classes
and one section of
Computers in
Modern Society
.
Besides teaching in CIS, I write
poetry
.  I've
published five books of poems, as well as an introductory
prose poem to a coffee table book of photographs of Florida:

Planting the Children
, University Press
of Florida, 1983.
Castings
, Countryman Press, 1984, second edition
Betony Press, 1992.
Across Her Broad Lap Something Wonderful
, State
Street Press, 1990 (out of print)
Forty-Four Ambitions for the Piano
, University Press
of Florida, 1990, second edition Betony Press, 1992.
Hunger
, University of Iowa Press, 1993 (Winner of
the Iowa Poetry Prize).
Visions of Florida
, with photographs by Woody
Walters, University Press of Florida, 1994.
There's a sixth book of poems,
Extranjera
forthcoming
from Story Line Press, and I'm working on a book of essays and a
children's story.  Besides writing, I most love to do poetry
readings, and have read (recited; I perform from memory) at many
universities and writing centers around the country.  Usually
when I read, I also teach a writing workshop.  My one peer
contact every year is attending the Associated Writing Programs
annual conference, a wonderful way to see friends and learn about
new writing.
