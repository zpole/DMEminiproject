As of September 1994, I am in the
EECS department
,
Lab for CS
, and
AI Lab
at

NEW!  Check out the Computational Geometry Impact Task Force's report,
"Application Challenges to Computational Geometry"
, also as
postscript
and
compressed postscript
, and
dvi
(or, anon ftp to graphics.lcs.mit.edu, then cd pub, get taskforce.ps.Z).
From 1993-94, I was a postdoc in computer graphics and
computational geometry at Princeton, working with Pat Hanrahan,
Michael Cohen, David Dobkin, and Bernard Chazelle.  The year before
that, I postdoc'ed at the Hebrew University Givat Ram campus in
Jerusalem.  From 1987-92, I was at UC Berkeley, completing a
dissertation with
Carlo Sequin
.
My research interests include global illumination algorithms;
visibility computations; constrained spatial subdivisions; visual
simulation; interactive algorithm visualization, verification and
animation; self-checking geometric algorithms; real-time ray-traced
imagery; and machine vision, including fully automated acquisition
of geometric models and other forms of data.
I head the
Synthetic
Imagery Group
, which is part of the
MIT Computer Graphics Group
.
Our main research emphases are
1)
digitizing whole cities
with pose-instrumented
(6-DOF) digital cameras; 2) managing and rendering
extremely complex geometric datasets
; 3) generating
real-time ray-traced imagery
on general-purpose (i.e., non-graphics)
hardware; and 4) techniques for remote, interactive, collaborative
undergraduate education
.
Also,
Julie Dorsey
has
recently joined the
Dept. of Architecture
and
Lab for Computer Science
at MIT, and is building the
Visual Simulation Group
.
This semester (Fall 1996), I'm teaching
6.837 (Introduction to
Computer Graphics)
, which will meet TR from 230-4pm in MIT
building/room
3-270
.
Spring 1996, I taught
6.046 (Introduction
to Algorithms)
, which met TR from 230-4pm in MIT building/room
2-190.

Fall 1995, I taught
6.837
(Introduction to Computer Graphics)
, formerly
6.037
(it was renumbered to reflect the
fact that graduate students can now take it for "G" credit).  The
course met MWF from 1-2pm in MIT building/room
E25-111.

When the ground isn't completely frozen (and, starting winter 1996, even when
it is), I play
ultimate

frisbee
.
I also like to bowl; my lifetime high score is
251
.
Finally, I enjoy
shrinking my friends
(like Rob Myers) -- no computers were used to make this picture!
here to see some
recent publications (with color figures!)
, including Ph.D. thesis
and Siggraph papers (please let me know if these are not previewable
or printable at your site);

here for some
useful computational geometry and graphics
codes;
here for some large and/or interesting
geometric datasets
,
including the Berkeley Soda Hall model.

Ouch!
hits.
