Hi, welcome to my home page!
I am a professor of computer science and engineering,
and I specialize in the design, implementation, and performance evaluation,
of computer systems software.
I lead a
research group
at the
UCSD Computer Systems Laboratory
,
where we work in the following
research areas
:


Operating Systems
:
kernel structure, support for multimedia agents, fast I/O and IPC


Networks
:
real-time communications,
wireless (mobile computing),
multicasting


Decentralized Control
:
multi-agent coordination, effects of delayed communication
A research topic I am especially interested in nowadays is
Internet Computing
.

I also teach
courses
mainly on operating systems at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels:

CSE 120 Principles of Operating Systems:
Fall 96
(
Spring 96
,
Fall 95
)

CSE 122 Operating Systems Laboratory:
(
Spring 96
)

CSE 221 Graduate Operating Systems:
(
Fall 95
)
I am involved in the following
extracurricular activities
:



Workshop: Network/OS Support for Digital Audio/Video (NOSSDAV 97)



ACM Workshop on Strategic Directions in Computing Research



Working Group on Storage I/O Issues in Large-Scale Computing



Working Group on Networking and Telecommunications Research



IDA Defense Science Study Group
