Publications




Teaching
,
Students



Experimental Algorithms,
EECS 498

The Web for Computer Scientists,
EECS 498

Algorithms, EECS 586

Parallel Computing, EECS
587

Parallel algorithms for
precollege students
,
a collaborative activity which gets the entire class
involved in learning about algorithms.
Current and Past
Students
(I've taught a few thousand, but these are
only a few of them)


Tutorials, Consulting





Tutorials in Parallel Computing:
have been taught at
U.S. Patent Office
, Ford Motor
Company, NASA, Supercomputing conferences, etc.  The next
conference presentation will be at Supercomputing 96.

Consulting on Parallel and High-Performance
Computing.
If interested, please contact me directly -
email
is usually the best way to reach me.
Organizations supporting past and present work of
myself and my students include IBM, AT&T, Digital, Unisys, Ford,
ARPA, NSA, NSF, NASA, NRL.


Past Lives



Childhood,
Euclid, Ohio.
Yes, I'm a Euclidean mathematician.
I had many superb math and science teachers in the public schools
there - special thanks to
Mrs. Eversole
and
Mr. Reno
.  Thanks also to Sputnik, for making America
improve its science education just in time
for me to participate in many innovative programs.
Why has Congress forgotten how important such educational
investments are???
Undergraduate,

Centre College,
Danville, Kentucky.
Intimate classes, intense faculty and students make for a great
experience, both in and out of class.  It deserves the
high ratings it gets among liberal arts colleges.
Doctorate,

Mathematics Department, Indiana University,
Bloomington, Indiana.
My thesis was
Schur Multiplication on B(H)
, 1977.
My very helpful advisor was
John B. Conway,
with many other faculty members
also offering useful advice and encouragement.

Assistant to Associate Professor,

Mathematical Sciences, Binghamton University,
Binghamton, New York.



Some addresses for me:

http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~qstout/
If you are close enough,
``Hi''
is also an effective address.

My office is 3120 EECS Building, North Campus.  (I'll move to 2242
EECS on 18 November.)
On Friday afternoons, starting at 4:30, I can often be found at the CSEG
happy hour, typically held in 3128 EECS.
