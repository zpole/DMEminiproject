Information
Dr. Joshi was born in New Delhi, India, many (or not so many, depending on
your POV) moons ago. Assorted geeeky acts like memorising the schedule for
Indian Railways (North Zone) at an early age showed to all and sundry that he
was destined to be a Professor. He set out to fulfil this prediction with
gusto, in the process asking long, complicated and troublesome questions of his
teachers at Modern School and
IIT Delhi
.
While in his senior years in high school, and through his undergraduate
education, he continued his interest in asking (and answering) questions by
representing his institutions in debating and quizzing at an intercollegiate
level. He also got involved in research activities, which lead him to
Purdue
University in 1989, from where he obtained his Ph.D degree in 1993. Currently,
he is found raoming the campus of the
University of Missouri
in the guise of an assistant professor. He
continues to ask many questions, though he concentrates on answering only
some of them. These are detailed next .....
Research

My research focusses on
Intelligent Networked Systems
, and covers the
broad area of
Networked Systems
and
Artificial/Computational
Intelligence
. Of particular interest to me is the use of
Distributed
AI (Adaptive MultiAgent Systems)
and
soft AI (NeuroFuzzy Learning)
approaches. I am working on using techniques from Computational Intelligence
and Agent-based systems to aid in the effort of realizing
MetaComputing
or
Networked computing
, especially for the
Scientific Computing domain. This involves creating problem solving
environments
(PSEs)
which make the underlying neworked and distributed
system transparent to the user.  This work also looks at supporting mobile
and ubiquitous platforms by making systems
mobile aware
. To this end
we do research in various facets of
Mobile Computing
. I also
investigate and using such systems with
multimedia
to improve
education
and
telelearning
. This work was started while I was at Purdue, as a part of the
efforts of the PSEs group (
John
Rice
,
Elias Houstis
and
Sanjiva Weerawarana
) and
the Telematics group (
Ahmed
Elmagarmid
,
Elias
Houstis
and
Mike
Atallah
).
Another current research activity deals
computer & human vision
, and explores the
nature of motion correspondence process in biological systems, using relevant
information from Neurobiology and Psychophysics. I am also working on
understanding the effect of the geometry of visual space on the human ability
to solve difficult problems. This work is done jointly with Prof. Zygmunt Pizlo of the
Psychology
department at Purdue.


Here are some of my
papers
.


Using Connectionist approaches to automate Problem solving
environments
SoftLab

AI issues in Mobile Computing :
SciencePad


Vision
, especially the motion correspondence problem

MOWSER
- a browser for mobile platforms, and
WebIQ
- support for disconencted browsing



My teaching activities
I teach a broad range of courses, from
Mobile Computing
to Operating Systems to Numerical Analysis.
I am curently teaching
AI I
and
