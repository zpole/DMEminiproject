Position




I am a professor
in the
Department
of Computer Science
at New York
University. I had
other
positions
before.








Research
Interests




My current
research interests center on metacomputing in general and
on the
MILAN
project
(and its
launching point
Calypso
) in
particular. My secondary research interests are
distributed computing, parallel computing, and database systems.
But my
research
addressed other areas of computer science. You can look
at the list of
publications
.








How to Reach
me




Office
:
My office is at 715 Broadway, room 702.
Email
:
I am easily reachable by
email
, which
I read generally at least once during every business day.
If I am away for more then one business day, I set up a
vacation message.

Phone
:
My office number is +1 212 998 3101; I check my voice
mail about once every business day, while in the US. My
home number is +1 212 477 3077 (voice mail may say:
"Rooney . . .," you can still leave a message
for me); voice mail is checked regularly. I also can be
reached by a cellular phone.


Fax
:
My office fax number is +1 212 995 4121; if I am not in
town I am not likely to know a fax has arrived; it is
generally good to alert me in other ways if a fax is being
sent. My home fax number is +1 212 477 3265; this is
where I prefer to get faxes, but only if I am in town.


Postal
Address
:


New York
University
251 Mercer Street
New York, NY 10012-1185
USA (no need to put if mailing from the US!)
