BACKGROUND

John P. Hayes has been a Professor of
EECS
at
the
University of Michigan
since
1982. Prior to that, he was on the faculty of the University of Southern
California, Los Angeles.  He teaches and conducts research in the areas of
computer-aided design and testing of digital systems, computer architecture,
VLSI design, and fault-tolerant computing. He was the founding director of
Michigan's
Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory
.
Prof. Hayes is the author
of five books including Computer Architecture and Organization,  (McGraw-Hill,
2nd ed. 1988), Layout Minimization for CMOS Cells, (Kluwer, 1992), and
Introduction to Digital Logic Design, (Addison-Wesley, 1993), as well as
numerous technical papers. He received  the B.E. degree from the National
University of Ireland, Dublin  and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Prof. Hayes is a Fellow of IEEE, and a
member of ACM and Sigma Xi.


CURRENT RESEARCH

Our  group  is currently conducting research on the following topics:
Hierarchical  testing of digital circuits; Built-in self-test (BIST); Design
verification; Fault-tolerant architectures  for safety-critical applications;
Design with field-programmable gates arrays (FPGAs); Automated layout methods
for CMOS cells; and  High-level timing analysis. The research is sponsored
by DARPA, NSF, and various industrial organizations.
For further information, see the list of  recent publications below.
Also see the DARPA-sponsored project on
hardware design verification for microprocessors
.
