Still a few moments for some research:

Digital Information Services

Click
here
for information on the Berkeley Digital Library Project.
An
IEEE Computer article
on this project is available.
What are
multivalent documents
(compressed Postscript)?  The architecture to support multivalent documents is described in our
DL'96 paper
(compressed Postscript).  (You can see a working demo on our digital library document collection.  See
About MVD
.)
How might we create a global, integrated, digital information service?
A
Framework for Distributed Digital Object Services
by Robert Kahn
and Robert Wilensky, offers some elements.
Can natural language processing facilitate information access?  Some of
my students and I think we can perform
