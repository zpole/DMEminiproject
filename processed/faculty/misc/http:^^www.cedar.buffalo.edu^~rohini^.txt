Rohini K. Srihari

Research Assistant Professor of Computer Science
State University of New York at Buffalo


Rohini Srihari is a Research Scientist at
CEDAR
.
She is concurrently a Research Assistant Professor in
the
Department of Computer Science
,
State University of New York
at Buffalo.
Her research centers on the use of linguistic
information in the interpretation of spatial (visual) data.
This research spans several sub-disciplines within AI including
computer vision, natural language understanding, spatial reasoning
and knowledge representation.
She heads three research efforts:
Language Models for Recognizing Handwritten Text
,
Use of Collateral Text in Understanding Photos in Documents
, and
Show&Tell: a Multimedia System for
Automatic Image Annotation and Content-Based Retrieval
.
She is the chair of a
AAAI symposium on
Computational Methods
for Integrating Language and Vision

to be held at MIT in November '95.
Rohini Srihari received a B. Math. In Computer Science
from the University of Waterloo, Canada.
She received a Ph.D. in Computer Science
from SUNY at Buffalo in 1992.
Her dissertation addressed the use of collateral text
in interpreting photographs.
