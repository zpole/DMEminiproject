I'm an Assistant Professor in the
Department of Computer Science
at the
University of Arizona
.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California
at Berkeley in 1994, my M.S. in Computer Science from the same place in 1990,
and my Sc.B. in Computer Science from Brown University in 1987. I've been
involved in the development of the Sprite operating system, the RAID
disk array, and the Zebra file system. At the moment my interests are
in scalable storage systems, network file systems, and distributed
operating systems.
As you can clearly tell, this page is under construction (and probably
always will be). The picture at the top has really got to go,
for starters. Maybe in my free time...
Research

I'm involved in the following research projects:


Swarm Storage System


Scout OS


Scalable I/O (SIO)

Liquid Software

A Cache Infrastructure for Modular Systems
