Amy W. Apon

Lecturer of Computer Science


Dr. Apon received her Ph.D. in Computer Science at
Vanderbilt University
in
August, 1994.
Dr. Apon also holds  an M.S. in computer science and and M.A. in
mathematics from the
University of Missouri-Columbia
.
and has a decade of diverse professional computer science experience.
She was a Software Design Engineer with Texas Instruments from
1983-1986 where she worked on artificial intelligence applications to
large military systems.
She was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science for four years at
East Central University
in Ada, Oklahoma, and also at
Fisk University
for one
year.
She was a Research Instructor
in the
Division of Biomedical
Informatics
at Vanderbilt University during 1995-1996, where she worked on
computer applications to medicine and on enterprise capacity planning.
Dr. Apon's research is in the areas of performance evaluation of distributed
and parallel computer systems and the development of new types of
analytic models of these, including queueing networks, Petri nets,
and simulation models.
She is also interested in research in the architecture and management of large distributed
networks and network applications, including
large medical information systems.
She has authored or coauthored several
papers
in the measurement and modeling
of parallel computer systems.
Many of her collaborators are members of the
Performance Evaluation
Group
at Vanderbilt.
She is the recipient of a research grant from the National Science Foundation
for the study of alternative models of distributed and parallel computer systems.
This year Dr. Apon is teaching in the
Department of Computer
Science
at Vanderbilt.
Courses she teaches in the department include:


CS 101:  Programming and
Problem Solving


CS 174: Programming in C


CS 281: Operating Systems Concepts


CS 283: Computer Networks
