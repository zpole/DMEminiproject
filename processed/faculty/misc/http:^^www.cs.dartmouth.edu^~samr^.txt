Research Interests

Professor Rebelsky's research interests include
programming languages
(particularly lazy
functional programming
,
the use of term rewriting systems in programming, and
techniques for multi-paradigm programming),
hypermedia
(systems,
interfaces, and retrieval), and the use of
computers in education
.
His thesis research was on the design and use of a demand-driven term-based
communication system.

curriculum
vitae

Teaching

I'm teaching two courses this term:
CS4
, a survey
course intended for nonmajors and
CS68
, a
majors-only course on programming languages.

I've taught a number of courses at
Dartmouth College
and
The University of Chicago
, including
introductory calculus, introductory programming (parts 1 and 2),
undergraduate programming langauges, graduate programming languages,
computer science for nonmajors, undergraduate operating systems and
undergraduate networking.

I also teach the occasional continuing education course, often on subjects
pertaining to electronic publishing.  These days, I've been teaching HTML
to a number of groups, and therefore maintain a rough collection of
online HTML references
.  I'm also starting
to teach JavaScript to a number of people (primarily in preparation for
using it in our nonmajors course) and have created some
JavaScript reference materials and examples
.


Fun

I'll admit that most of my free time is spent with my wife and new son
(born July 31, 1996)

On a completely separate note, also maintain the
Jonathan Richman FAQ
, but I
haven't had a lot of time for that in recent months.

I also waste my free time collecting music (my tastes vary -- roots rock,
singer-songwriters, power pop, great Boston bands, ...).  One great place
to look for independent music on the net is
the
Indie Ocean
, and
I'm not saying that just because they bribed me to.  They carry lots of
great Boston-based musicians, like Barrence Whitfield and Robin Lane.


Disclaimer

This is not a fancy page (but you could tell that).  This is because I
am a strong proponent of
logical
markup, rather than
physical
markup.  That is, I believe most HTML authors should
place emphasis on indicating the
role
of each piece of text,
rather than the
appearance
of that text.
