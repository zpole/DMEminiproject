Gene Myers


Gene Myers is a Professor of Computer Science
at the University of Arizona.  He received his Ph.D in Computer Science
from the University of Colorado in 1981.  His research interests
include design of algorithms, pattern matching, computer graphics, and
computational molecular biology.
His most recent academic work has focused on algorithms for the
central combinatorial problems involved in DNA sequencing, and
on a wide range of sequence and pattern comparison problems.
Among the tools he has developed are
Blast
-- a widely used tool
for protein similarity searches,
Anrep
-- a pattern matching language
for applications in molecular biology, and
MacMolecule
-- a molecular
visualization tool for Apple computers.  Dr. Myers is an editor
for Computer Application in the Biosciences, the Journal of Computational
Biology, and
Gene-COMBIS
-- an electronic journal.
