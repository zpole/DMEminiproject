programming environment. (Click here for a
Castle overview slide.





GATOR
is an effort to parallelize a model of the earth's
atmospheric chemistry, and integrate it into an Earth Systems Model
encompassing atmospheric dynamics and physics, ocean dynamics, physics
and eventually chemistry, satellite data, scientific visualization,
and a very large database.

Computational Science Education Project
provides an on-line
text book on high-performance computing. I co-authored the chapter on

Parallel Numerical Linear Algebra
.



CS 267
is a
one-semester graduate class in
Applications of Parallel Computers.





(Spring 1995 version of CS 267
)



NSF-CBMS Short Course on
Parallel Numerical Linear Algebra

Spring 1995 version of CS 267
.






Biographical Sketch:



James Demmel received his BS in Mathematics from
Caltech
in 1975 and his
Ph.D. in
Computer Science
from
UC Berkeley
in 1983. After spending six
years on the faculty of the
Courant Institute
,
New York University
, he joined the
Computer Science Division
and
Mathematics Department
at
Berkeley
in 1990,
where he holds a joint appointment.
