Joseph F. Traub


I am a Professor of Computer Science in the
Columbia University Computer Science Department
.
Much of my research is joint work with Professor
Henryk Wozniakowski
.
The work ranges from fundamental research on information-based
complexity to large-scale applications in mathematical finance to the
building of software.  I'll discuss some aspects of this work.




Information-Based Complexity


Breaking Intractability


Financial Computations


Low Discrepancy Algorithms


Path Integrals


Randomization


Limits to Scientific Knowledge



You may look at my list of
publications
,
some of which are available online.
