Jim's primary research interest is in Artificial Intelligence, especially
the area of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). His research has focused
on granularity-based reasoning to recognize student strategies and on
Collaborative Learning in peer help.
Jim is the current Director of the
ARIES
Laboratory
(the Laboratory for Advanced Research in Intelligent Educational Systems)
and an active member of the Department's
Ether
group.  Major
research activities include the Peer Helper Identification project funded
through the
TeleLearning
Network of
Centres of Excellence, the
MicroWeb
Project funded by Saskatchewan Education, and a brand new initiative
to integrate peer help with FAQ management (temporarily dubbed FAQ-Man for
want of a better name).
He serves on the editorial board of the journal "Artificial Intelligence

on international conference program committees including "UM'94" "ICCE'95"
"ITS'96" "Calisce'96" "CSCSI'96" "KBCS'96" and "PEG'96".  Jim was program
chair for the 7th World Conference on AI in Education held in Washington
DC in August, 1995 and is on the program committee for the upcoming
