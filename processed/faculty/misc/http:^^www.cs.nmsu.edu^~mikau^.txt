Research  Areas


Programming Languages Design and Implementation
One of the recent results in this area was the design of compiler writing language
RIGAL.

RIGAL Home Page
is
maintained by Vadim Engelson at University of Linkoping, Sweden.
Testing and Debugging Automation, Assertion Languages.
Here is a  link to the
Algorithmic and Automatic Debugging Home Page.
Any inputs and suggestions are
very welcome.
Visual Programming Languages.
First draft of the experimental visual programming language V in PostScript can be
downloaded

here.


Software Engineering


Seminar on Programming Environments and Tools
is being held on Fridays, 1.30 - 2.30 PM, Science Hall, Sh 124.
If you are interested to be on the mailing list, please,
