H.T. Kung

Gordon McKay Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

Division of Applied Sciences

Harvard University


COMPUTER NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS

Professor Kung teaches courses in computer science and communications
systems and leads a research team in these areas.
Prior to joining Harvard in 1992, Dr. Kung was on the faculty of
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for 17 years. He designed and
built several high-speed computers and networks.
Dr. Kung's current research is directed toward the design of
high-speed computer and communications networks. At Harvard his
research team has developed with its industrial partner
an experimental ATM (Asynchronous
Transfer Mode) switch with 622 megabits per second ports.
Five copies of the switch have been build.
Design and experiment of new protocols and applications are being
conducted on networks based on this switch.
See project descriptions
here
and

,
and performance traces measured on the switch
here
.
In connection with a project course, the
team has also developed a radio-based mobile Internet system capable
of providing secure short-cut routing.
Complementary to his academic activities, Dr. Kung maintains a strong
linkage with industry. He has taken several leaves from his university
positions to work with companies.
Professor Kung is Conference Chair for the
Harvard Conference on the Internet and Society
to be held in May 28-31, 1996.
