environments, focusing on Distributed Shared Memory Systems (
DSM
) and
mobile computing  support using DSM.
Distributed Computing
Operating Systems
Large scale computing systems
Workstation environments

Reliability and Availability


RESEARCH PROJECTS



The Mirage, Mirage+, and Oasis Project(s)



"The Persistence of Memory - S. M. Dali"


Mirage Development Team
-
a Loosely coupled Distributed Shared Memory system.


LAB FACILITIES
I currently direct two laboratories.  The Operating Systems
research lab and the Distributed Systems research laboratory.  We house
12 IBM PS/2 computers that run Mirage+, 9 Dec Alpha AXP computers,
a Macintosh, and a Sun.  We also work with industry at a local and
national level.  Specifically,
Computer Marketplace Inc
has provided 6 RS6000 machines for a research cluster we are
designing. We also will obtain 5 PowerPC computers
from
IBM
that will be
used for research and instruction.  The PowerPCs run the
new IBM microkernel and OS Workplace shell.  We also acknowledge
Digital Equipment Corporation
and their
External Research program which helped us obtain
the Alphas. Both Systems Laboratories are used
to design, implement, and measure the performance of
operating systems, distributed systems,and to study DSM.


CORPORATE CONSULTING
Explore the endless possibilities of working with the University of
California students and faculty.  Please contact me via email
brett@cs.ucr.edu
for further
information.  Our group works on UNIX, AIX, HP-UX, DEC UNIX, OSF/1,
Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows-NT, Lynx, SunOS, and Solaris.

web site network was set up by our students.

STUDENT THESIS'
Here are thesis' by students that I have supervised.

Cheryl DeMatteis, The Design of Reliable Mirage+, M.S. Thesis,
March 1996. 155 pages.

Bill Schroeder, The Architecture of the Oasis Mobile Shared Virtual
Memory System, M.S. Thesis, June 1996, 172 pages.

David Choweller, Mechanisms for Distributed Synchronization, in
progress, expected completion December 1996.



COFFEE
I drink alot of it.  I prefer the Sumatra Blue Linoting beans
that Trader Joes sells or a brand called Dancing Goats that
Batdorf Bronson roasters ships to me retail.  Basically a medium
smooth roast is best for me.  Fine coffee should be savored
and certainly no fake powdered milk should be used in it.  The
Cafe San VIP Sanyo coffeemaker in my office has a built-in
grinder that auto grinds and then drips the coffee.
Unfortunately, like the Intel 432, this machine
was too complex -- thus the vender has discontinued production
of the machine. I am currently searching for a machine of equivalent
functionality for the day my one remaining machine dies.
