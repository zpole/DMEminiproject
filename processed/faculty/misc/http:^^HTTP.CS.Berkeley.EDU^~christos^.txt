I am teaching
(fall 1996)
two sections of CS170 "Introduction to Algorithms"
together with
Umesh Vazirani
office hours and TA to be announced.
I am also a CS undergraduate advisor.  Office hours for the week
of August 19:  Tue 10-12, Thu 2-4, Fri 10-12.
Please sign up outside my door for an appointment.


I studied
in Athens Polytechnic (BS in EE 1972)
and Princeton (PhD in CS 1976).
Since then,
I have taught
at Harvard, MIT, Athens
Polytechnic, Stanford, and UC San Diego.
I came to Berkeley in January 1996 (but I was here also in 1979 as
a Miller fellow).

I am interested
in the theory of algorithms and
complexity, and its applications to databases, optimization, AI,
and game theory.

I have written
these books


Elements of the theory of computation
(Prentice-Hall 1982, with Harry Lewis,
second edition
to appear soon
)

Combinatorial optimization: algorithms and complexity
(Prentice-Hall 1982, with Ken Steiglitz)

The theory of database concurrency control
(CS Press 1988)

Computational Complexity
(Addison Wesley, 1994)
and many papers.
