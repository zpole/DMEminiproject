In Fall 1996, I am teaching two courses.
COMP 50: Computing on the Internet
is an introduction to computing and to the Internet for those with little
or no background with computers.
COMP 40: Computer Architecture
treats aspects of computer hardware that are most relevant to software
development.
In the past, I have also taught courses in compilers, parallel computing,
and operating systems.
My
research
interests include discrete mathematics, parallel computing,
and system software.
My personal interests include playing soccer, hiking and nontechnical
climbing, music (I play numerous instruments, none well), and photography.
My wife and I live in Winchester, Mass.
We have two children; one is at Colorado College and the other is a graduate
of Carleton College now at Cornell Law School.
I grew up in Oklahoma and went to school at the University of
California at Berkeley where I earned a bachelor's degree in
Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and a Ph.D. in
Applied Mathematics.
With my family, I
have traveled extensively in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.
