Research Interests

Robotics and artificial intelligence
with emphasis on designing algorithms, analysis tools, and
environments to support the solution of complex high-dimensional
problems governed by physical laws.
Applications in  molecular biology (computer-aided
pharmaceutical drug design), and medicine (robot-assisted surgery).



Teaching

Spring 1997:
Algorithmic Robotics
