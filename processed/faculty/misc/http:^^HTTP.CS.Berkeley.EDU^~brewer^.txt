Research
My primary research interests include parallel systems, networks,
network software, security, and mobile computing.
Check out
Inktomi
, the fastest
and one of the largest full-text search engines for the Web.

Randy Katz
and I have started a mobile computing project,
Daedalus
, to look at
handoff across overlaid networks and
applications that can adapt
to changing network conditions.  This project includes the
Bay Area Research Wireless Access Network (BARWAN)
.

We have also formed a new group to study and improve internet security, called
ISAAC
.
I also work with the
Berkeley NOW Project
and the
InfoPad
group.
