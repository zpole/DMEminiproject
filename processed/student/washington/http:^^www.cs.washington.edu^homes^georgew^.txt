My interests are computer graphics and multimedia. My thesis work, done
under the supervision of professor
David Salesin
,
deals with applying traditional pen-and-ink illustration techniques to the
automatic rendering of three-dimensional models. A few pen-and-ink images
created with our prototype rendering system can be found
here
