Work World

My research interests include operating systems, distributed and
parallel systems, networking, and security.  Currently, with help from
my advisor,
John
Zahorjan
, I'm building system support for running soft real-time
applications (e.g., visualization) on partially idle workstations in
NOWs.  Recently, I completed a study on how runtime measurements of
application characteristics can be used by a runtime system to
minimize application execution time in uniprogrammed multiprocessors
environments as well as by a system scheduler to make "good"
global scheduling decisions in multiprogrammed multiprocessors
environments.
