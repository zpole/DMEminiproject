Danny Padwa's Page

This is a relatively skimpy "home page" - I hope to be enhancing it
shortly.

I am currently a graduate student in the
Computer Science department
at NYU.

To see a little about my past life, please try my
biography
.

You can now view pictures from
my wedding
.

I recently (August 1996) received my first patent!  This is based upon
work that I did seven summers earlier.  You can view
an abstract of the patent
on-line.
