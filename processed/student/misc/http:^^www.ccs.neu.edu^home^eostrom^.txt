Erik Ostrom's home page



A certain substance
This page and the ones it points to are basically just a fancy version
of my hotlist--stuff I think is interesting that's out on the web.
Eventually I may add personal details, like fascinating facts and
spicy gossip about my life.  It'll be just like
Tiger
Beat
.



MUDs

Oops, I mean "text-based virtual realities".

WWW

This is where you came in.

Some Colleges in Boston

Just what it sounds like.

Papers

Some papers I like.

Electronic Texts

I'm not sure how this is different from "papers", but it is.

Information Sources

Places to go searching for stuff.

Sites

Servers that are interesting for themselves, not just for what
they contain.

Hypertext

Maybe it should cut down on the caffeine.  Maybe I should.

Computing and the Humanities

What?  At the SAME TIME?  Don't you know that's DANGEROUS?

Education

You've heard of it.

Personal Info

Stuff related to me.

Miscellaneous

Whatever didn't fit anywhere else.
