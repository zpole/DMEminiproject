Java, KQML, Agents and CORBA Pointers
Hi, I am
AJ
. I am a graduate student in the
Department of Computer Science
, at
North Carolina
State University
.  I am currently working with
Dr. Munindar P. Singh
in
Database Laboratory
as a research assistant.
My research interest areas include
development of workflow technology in heterogenous environment,
database management, and networking.
If you would like to know more about maintaining database
consistency in heterogenous environemnt, please send me an
email
.  I am in the process of developing a software for my research.
Since there is no clear victor in the area of workflow technology,
such as, Sagas, ConTract, DOM and ACTA to name a few, the
area is wide open. Placed in this situation the industry
and scientific community is trying to solve this problem
for many years.  Here, at NC State, Dr. Singh and I are
hoping to make a significant contribution to the workflow
problem solution and trying to come up with a software that
would address many challenging problems unaddressed so far.
