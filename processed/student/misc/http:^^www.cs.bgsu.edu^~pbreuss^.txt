Philipp Breuss is pursuing an advanced degree in

and
History at the
University
of Salzburg
, Austria. He began his studies in 1990 and
has since developed a strong interest in multi-media programming which
allows him to combine his graphic talent with his analytical programming
skills. In 1993, he gained valuable practical experience in the design
of  a multi-media information system for the Hohe Tauern National Park in
Austria. After that, he participated in the development of a multi-media city
guide to Paris which has been published on CD-ROM by Tewi in Munich. On a
more scientific level, he has participated in the design of
FILCOM
, a
multilingual resource system for domain-specific knowledge. FILCOM was
initiated by Prof. Wilfried Wieden of the Department of English and
American Studies at the University of Salzburg. From Dec. 1994 until
March 1995 Mr. Breuss had a COMETT internship in Germany. From April to June
1995, he was an exchange student at the
University of Amsterdam.

the
State University of Ohio in Bowling
Green
