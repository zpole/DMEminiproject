I
first programmed the game of otherllo
during my undergraduate degree, as a project for an Artificial
Intelligence course (c.s. 308-424).  My program was written in
C and ran on DOS.  Later, I updated this my game to run on
Windows ©, this time, my program was written in Visual C++.
After having been introduced to CGI programning, I decided to
update my game of Othello for the third time and to put it on
the Internet.  The game has been up and running since September 1995.



The Rules and Origin of Othello


This game now runs through the use of
CGI
's
(Common Gateway Interface).  Anyone can play, through the internet,
against the computer on which this WEB Server is installed.




If you want to play a game of Othello, please follow this
