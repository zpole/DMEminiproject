For those of you who don't know me I'm a Ph.D. student at
North Carolina State University in the Computer Science Department.
I currently have a Masters of Computer Science, a Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science, and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.
My main areas of interest are formal methods, operating systems, and
programming languages.  I'm working with
Dr. Rance Cleaveland
as a research assistant.

This summer my wife, Seunghee Lee, and I went on a vacation to
Europe.  If you'd like to see a few pictures from our trip
