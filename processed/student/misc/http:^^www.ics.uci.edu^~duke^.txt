Duke P. Hong is a graduate student at the University of California,
Irvine where he is pursuing his Ph.D. in computer science. His
research interests are in the architecture and performance analysis
of data traffic over ATM networks. He has been with the

Network Research Group

led by
Prof. Tatsuya Suda
since 1990. He has published a number of papers on connectionless
servers for ATM and ATM congestion control.


E
DUCATION


Currently pursuing Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science at
the
University of California, Irvine
.
Thesis work is progressing
in two stages.  The first stage, design of a connectionless server
for transmitting connectionless datagrams over the connection oriented
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network and performance analysis
through simulations and analysis, is nearly complete having resulted
in a paper currently in submission.  The second stage, an exploration
of the potential fractal nature of ATM traffic is currently in progress.
Completion is expected in 1997.

M.S. Information and Computer Science,
University of California, Irvine
, June 1993.
Investigated Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks
and congestion control techniques.

B.S. Computer Engineering,
University
of California, San Diego
,
June 1990.  Courses were distributed among the software oriented
computer science and the hardware oriented electrical engineering
fields.

The following is a brief synopsis of work in progress.


Data over ATM
:
Packet loss probability in a multiplexer is being investigated
with several packet level cell discarding schemes.  The discarding
schemes drop useless cells from a packet that has already
suffered a cell loss.

ATM Connectionless Service
:
Most of work my in
ATM connectionless service is being summarized
into a paper to be submitted at a later date.

ATM Traffic Characteristics and Self-Similarity
:
Efficient methods to evaluate the performance of
self-similar traffic is being investigated.
I currently do not have any papers in submission, but this one
is in preparation for one.
