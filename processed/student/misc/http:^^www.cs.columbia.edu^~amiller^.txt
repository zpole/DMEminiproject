Hello and welcome to the corner of this vast web I call home.
I know it's fairly meager, but consider it a work in progress.


A short history


B.A. received May, 1995 from
Hamilton College

Intern at the
MCS Division
of Argonne National Laboratory

As an undergraduate at Hamilton, a small liberal arts college in upstate
New York, I majored in Computer Science and minored in Physics, however,
I also studied a wide variety of other, more diverse topics as well.
I spent two Summers at the Math and Computer Science Division of Argonne
National Laboratory as a member of the Futures Lab.  Specifically I helped
construct, and maintain the CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment.  The
CAVE
is an immersive, multiple user, virtual environment that was featured at
SIGGRAPH 94.  Most recently I was involved with the further development and
improvement of the user tracking software.


What I'm doing now
Currently I am a second year PhD student working in the Robotics group under
Peter Allen.  I am presently buried in books to study for a qualifier, but
when I do have time for research it includes:

Real-time vision tracking systems for grasping.
Intelligent trackers.
Tactile sensing.
Applying the above to our Barrett Hand.

My other interests (when I actually have a free moment) include swimming,
camping in the Adirondacks, skiing, karate, going to Yankee Games, and enjoying
good microbrews.
Perhaps you'd like to see some
photos
from Turkey or Mt. Katahdin in Maine.
