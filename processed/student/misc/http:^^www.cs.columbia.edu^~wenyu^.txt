Wenyu's Home Page

Welcome to my homepage.
I am a second-year Ph.D. student working for
Prof. Gail Kaiser
. I spent my first two years at
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
in the
TR Class
, then I transferred to
University of Bridgeport
, where I just got my B.S. degree. I am also currently a member of
UPE (Upsilon Pi Epsilon) in Connecticut Delta Chapter
.

Here is a
picture
I took recently.
I am TAing the continuous algorithms course W4241 this semester, if
you are taking the course, you can visit
the
course homepage
.
Here is some useful (and hopefully interesting) homepages I have
found on the Internet. If you are looking for help on various Unix
tools, like Latex, Emacs, Lex/Yacc, this may be a place to
go
.
My homepage is still under construction, so any good advice is welcome.
