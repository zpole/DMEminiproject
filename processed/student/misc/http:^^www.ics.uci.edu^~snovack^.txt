Curriculum vitae


Contact Info:
I am finishing my PhD
in absentia
at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign.  My address there is:



Center for Supercomputing Research and Development
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
Room 410 CSRL, 1308 W. Main St., Urbana IL 61801
office:  (217) 244-0070

Research Project:
As part of my thesis work I designed and developed
EVE,
a retargetable,
parallelizing compiler for fine-grain parallel architectures
.
My general research interests include parallel algorithms and
architectures, parallelizing compilers, and hardware/software
codesign.

Leisure Activities:
Despite what my advisor may tell you, ;-) I don't actually have much free time,
but I have been known to


Dance Israeli folk dances (Favorite dance:  Shorashim)
I don't go regularly any longer, but if you are interested
in giving it a try, let me know.  I still enjoy going from
time to time.

Jump out of airplanes:  I've only done this twice, but I am
totally hooked.  As soon as I scrape up the time and money
I'm going again.  Anyone interested in joining me?  [I can
get you $10 off... ;-)]

Hurtle down mountainsides:  Skiing is a recent
hobby for me.  Once I discovered the homomorphism that mapped my
childhood sport of ice hockey to skiing, I was off (just imagine
playing ice hockey with really long skates on an inclined surface ---
everything else is the same, especially if you get in my way ;-> ).

Ride a bike:  My wife and I are working up to our first "century"
(100 mile) trip, from Newport Beach to San Diego.

Read:  My favorite authors are Toni Morrison
(especially her books "Song of Soloman" and "Beloved")
and Don DeLillo (especially "The Names" and "Ratner's Star").

Dabble in foreign languages:  Right now, I just
try to re-acquire whatever limited foreign language abilities I ever had.
Languages that I forget more and more of on a daily basis are
Hebrew (I can still speak, read, and write, but not very well),
Spanish (can't speak or write, but for some strange reason I can
understand a lot), and Japanese (I just nod knowingly).
