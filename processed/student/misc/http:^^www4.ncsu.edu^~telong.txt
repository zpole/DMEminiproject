All You Never Wanted To Know About Ted Long








Ted's Homepage















My undergraduate studies were completed at

East Carolina University
.  I
spent several years hiding out here.   Much to my dismay,
graduation day came and I had to enter the real world.







During my undergraduate studies and for 5 years after graduation, I
worked at
Nortel
.  I made some
great friends here while building experience as a Software Engineer
and Unix tool developer.







I worked at
BSG
in a
very fast-paced and cutting-edge environment until I decided to go
back to school full-time. I specialized in Graphical User Interface design and
object-oriented development using C++/Motif.
It was a great job, but I wanted to complete my degree and now
seems like the best time.







I now work as a Teaching Assistant for
CSC517 - Object-Oriented Languages and Systems
.
Since going back to school, I feel like I
once again have control of my destiny and that I'm making progress on
the things that are important to me.  I am
working on an MCS degree in the Department of Computer Science at
NCSU
.





























Meyers-Briggs describes me as an
INFP
.







Here are some of my
