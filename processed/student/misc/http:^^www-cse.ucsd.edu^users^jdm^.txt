"The way I got it figgered, man is like a tree beetle.  He's gonna
eat himself outta house an' home an' keep fuckin' things up, an' after
the human race is gone things'll get good again. Ya can't talk no
sense inta tree beetles, an' ya can't talk no sense inta human bein's
neither.  Me--I'm gonna get my share while the gettin's still good."

"We have brains.  Beetles don't," somebody else hollered.

"Brains just make a man do crazy things," Cap said.  That's all Cap said.
