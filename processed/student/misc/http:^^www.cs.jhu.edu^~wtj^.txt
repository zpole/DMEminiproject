About Me
I am a PhD student studying
Programming Languages
and Software Systems
at
The Hopkins Objects Group
led by
Dr. Scott Smith
.
And I am also working on the
Commedia
project directed by
Dr. Yair Amir
.
Before coming to
Johns Hopkins
,
I worked as a computer programmer for several years
in  China.
Some programs  I created in the beautiful
Beijing
are still running all over
China.

I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science
at
the
Special Class for Gifted Young
of the
University of Science and Technology of China
.


Here
is a snapshot
of the type inference system I recently constructed.
