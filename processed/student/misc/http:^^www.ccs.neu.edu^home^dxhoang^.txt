D.X.Hoang's Homepage






Dustin X. Hoang


Your daily life is your temple and religion. Whenever you enter into
it take with you your all. -- Kahlil Gibran

When hungry, eat; when tired, sleep. -- Po-chang

Welcome to my homepage. Instead of boring you with trivial information
about myself, I've compiled some links and information, separated into
a number of different categories, which some of you may find of interest.
Enjoy!
