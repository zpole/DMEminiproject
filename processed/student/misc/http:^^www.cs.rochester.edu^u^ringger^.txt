B.S. (1992)

M.S. (1994)

I'm a Ph.D. student working on
the interface between
Speech Recognition
and
Natural Language Understanding
,
incorporating
Prosody
.  I work with
Prof. James Allen
and other members of the
TRAINS
research group.  Visit our
Speech research page
.
My other research interests include:

Pattern Recognition,
Statistical Language Learning and Processing,
Human-Computer Interaction,
Multimodal Interfaces.

Most recently,
James
,
Brad Miller
,
George Ferguson
, and I have been
working on a
conversationally proficient logistical planning
assistant
.
"TRAINS-96"
.
The '96 system involves several modes of transportation, cargo, and a
sophisticated model of cost.  Depending on the research perspective,
we also call the system a "natural dialgoue system" and a
"mixed-initiative planning assistant"

In the not too distant future, we hope to put TRAINS here on the Web.
For the time being, a
QuickTime movie (10 MB)
of a dialogue with TRAINS-95 will
have to do.

During recent summers, I have worked with the
Natural Language Processing research group
at
Microsoft Research
.
The
Speech Recognition group
there is also doing some
interesting work
.  Likewise for the
User Interfaces group
.
