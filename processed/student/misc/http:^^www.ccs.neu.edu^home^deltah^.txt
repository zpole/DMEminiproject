Hello!  I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the
College of Computer Science
(CCS) at
Northeastern University
.
Currently I am working with
Prof. Harriet Fell
and
Prof. Vierra Proulx
, and I'm
currently a member of the
BBB
team. My main interests include but are not limited to Computers and
Education, Classroom Research and development of multimedia systems.
I was born and raised in Thessaloniki, Greece where I acquired my Bachelor
degree in Mathematics. In Greece I worked for four years as a private
tutor. At
NU
I was briefly a tutor at
the Math Center as well as a proctor at the Unix and Mac Labs of
CCS
.
I also worked as a full time research assistant at the Biological
Knowledge Laboratory. I am very involved with life at the
CCS
. I have already served as
GROK chairperson for more than a year and as GROK vice-president for
an additional year. Currently I am the
CCS's
representative at the Graduate Student Association.
