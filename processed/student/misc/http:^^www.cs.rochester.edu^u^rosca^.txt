Epistle:

When, at night, with drooping eyelids, I blow out the candles flare
Time's unending path is followed only by the old clock there;
For just draw aside the curtains and the moon will flood the room
With a fire of passions summoned by the ardous of her gloom;
From the night of recollection she will resurrect an eon
Of distress - which we, however, sense as in a dream-like paean.
-- Eminescu


Research Interests
My research interests are in the areas of Machine Learning and
Evolutionary Computation. I am particularly interested in the
emergence of self-organization and adaptive principles, the scaling
problem in learning and in methods for coupling learning and simulated
evolution. Application areas include autonomous agents, mobile robots,
synthesis of modular neural networks, image analysis and feature
discovery, data mining and knowledge discovery.  Currently, I am
working on a scalable Genetic Programming system called
Adaptive
Representation through Learning
. I'm constantly contaminated with
steadfast encouragement and unbounded enthusiasm from my advisor,
Prof. Dana Ballard
