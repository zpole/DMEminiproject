I am currently on two-year sabbatical from my Ph.D. tenure at our famed Computer Science Department. But I do stay
at the same Old(en) place and have the same advisor (now boss) -- Professor
Kai Li
.
My primary duty involves Princeton's
Scalable I/O Projects
, among
which I've been developing this deliverable software for the SIO/Intel
community -- a user-level checkpointing library,
LibNXckpt
, for
Intel
Paragon
multi-computer. Please click and check it out. My duty also includes
some support work for Princeton's other SIO projects. In addtion, I do some work for
SHRIMP
projects. Last summer, I
wrote the Linux device driver for our SHRIMP hardware and later on helped
several people adding new features to it.
In the fall of 1997, I will come back to become a third-year graduate student.
All that's left is a thesis -- what all of us here sweat for five years for.
