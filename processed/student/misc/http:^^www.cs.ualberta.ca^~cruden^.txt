Charles's weird and wonderful homepage



Charles Cruden

E-mail:

cruden@cs.ualberta.ca



Welcome to this newly constructed homepage!  Random inspiration struck me to
get my act together and actually put a homepage up.  It's not much, but it
takes up disk space, which is at least one of the purposes of a home page.
Consider this page to be under heavily abandoned construction.



And now... the links!


Who is this Charles Cruden guy anyway?


Some links I frequent


BBS stuff
