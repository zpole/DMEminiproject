Welcome to



Doug Talbert's


Home Page


I am a Ph.D. candidate in
the
Computer Science Department
at
Vanderbilt University
.
My area of research is artificial intelligence with an emphasis
on machine learning. My research is focused on exploring the
interactions among different types of clusterings of first-order
logic descriptions. I am also interested in data mining. My
advisor is
Dr. Douglas H.
Fisher
.
I am being funded by the
Division of Biomedical Informatics
at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center
as part of collaboration between the
Computer Science Department and the Informatics Division. I am
working on an intelligent interface between the hospital's
order-entry computer system and the hospital's pharmacy computer
system. I am particularly
interested in applying machine learning techniques to the vast
amounts of data in hospital databases in an effort to provide
better decision support to health care professionals.
My M.S. degree is from Vanderbilt in computer science.
The title of my M.S. paper is
Automating the Search for
Multiple Data Models
.
My B.S. degree is from
