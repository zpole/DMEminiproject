PANKAJ KULKARNI













Hi, I'm 22 (born in 1973),  5'3', 55kg. I hail from
Hyderabad
, capital of
Andhra Pradesh
, India. My address, phone no, and similar stuff
are in my
plan
file
.


After four years of pleasant stay at
Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras
in my home country,
India
,
I was asked to
leave the place with an undergraduate degree in computer science.
For those four years I lived at
Godavari
Hostel
.


So here I am now, in
New York City
,
at the
Columbia University
where
the
Dept. of Computer Science
has
admitted me in the fond hope that someday
they can give me a Ph.D.
