Academic Interests

I am interested in Machine Learning
techiniques especially inductive learning, using prototypes to represent
concepts, classification, and clustering.

Currently I am applying machine learning systems to medical
databases, more specifically an Alzheimer's database.  We want to use
machine learning to increase the accuracy of patient screening tests.

Papers


Improving Dementia Screening Tests with Machine Learning Methods
with William Rodman Shankle, Michael Pazzani, and Michael Dillencourt, in
Alzheimer's Research, June 1996, vol. 2 no. 3.

Applying
Machine Learning to an Alzheimer's Database
, with William Rodman
Shankle and Michael Pazzani, in the technical notes for AAAI-96
Spring Symposium AI in Medicine: Applications of Current Technologies.

Learning
Prototypical Concept Descriptions
with Dennis Kibler in the
Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Machine Learning
(1995).

Concept
Sharing: A Means to Improve Multi-Concept Learning
, with Dennis Kibler,
in the Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Machine
Learning (1993).

Other Interests
Some activities I enjoy: hiking, backpacking, aerobics, vollyball,
cooking. I like cats too.
I am always looking for new ideas for lowfat recipes. Check out
the fatfree vegetarian archive
or
Julie's Low and
Fat-free Resource list
.  If you are looking for places to eat
around town,
Dining out
of the web
has some interesting suggestions.
