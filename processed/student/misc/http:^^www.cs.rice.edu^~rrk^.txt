go visit him anyway - he's my brother



I am a 4th year graduate student at
Rice
University
, working towards my doctorate in Computer Engineering. My
thesis work is on the performance debugging of shared-memory parallel
programs;
Alan Cox
is my thesis
advisor.
Here's a little bit about myself. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree
in Electrical Engineering from the
Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras
.
Two years of work at
North Carolina State
University
earned me a Master's degree in Computer Engineering. Since
then, I've been at Rice. From August 1996, I am being supported by an
IBM
corporate fellowship.
Research Work
I have been involved in various research projects at Rice. Here are some of
the interesting projects I am working on.


TreadMarks
- software distributed shared memory for parallel computers.
My dissertation work is on developing a
source-level
performance
debugging approach for improving the performance of parallel programs.

for more information.
I am also interested in looking at compiler strategies for improving
the performance of shared-memory systems. Specifically, I have explored
methods to reduce the coherence traffic in shared-memory systems by
compiler intervention.
I have also worked on the Rice Parallel Processing
Testbed (RPPT) project. This project has created a unified
architecture, interconnection network and memory hierarchy simulator. Neat
stuff, contact
Prof. Jump
in
the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department for more information on
this.

Resumania!
