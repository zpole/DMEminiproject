Research Interests
My research interests include object-oriented databases and
persistent programming languages.
Links listed here belong to several different categories:

Literature search

Various interesting groups and projects

Other research-related links

Programming


I am currently working on the database programming language for
TIGUKAT Objectbase Management System
. These are the (desired)
properties of the language:

Strong static typing with the possibility of dynamic typing
Well-defined semantics
Self-reflection
Flexible and possibly user-definable syntax
Tight integration with the database. This includes

Orthogonality of type and persistence
Integrated query language
Ability to operate with and invoke code stored in the database
View description mechanism
Transaction support


Here
is a set of slides that represents an overview of the system.
