Welcome to my little world.  Stay awhile and have a look around.  I'm a PhD
student in computer science at the Univerity of California,
Irvine.  My interests are primarily in the theoretical aspects of systems
design: caching, paging, and scheduling.  In the real world, I have a lot
of hobbies and interests, ranging from automobiles to zoology.  If you look
around, you may find something that interests you.
