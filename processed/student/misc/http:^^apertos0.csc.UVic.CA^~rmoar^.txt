Roger Moar

Biography: I'm a graduate student (M.Sc. in Computer Science) at the University
of Victoria. I am part of the
PANDA
group, which does operating systems research. My thesis work involves
safety and security in download extensible operating systems. I am also
interested in computer security in general, as it never ceases to amaze
me how many hours of work are entrusted to insecure (and therefore essentially
compromised) machines.
A little security info:


Some information on
X Window System
Security

Sites of (my) interest:
