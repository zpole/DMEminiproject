Computer
Science Department





Since August 91 I'm on leave of absence from the
Computer Science Department
of the
University
of Sao Paulo
(Brazil), pursuing a PhD degree at UNM.
My current reseach interests are
distributed object
computing
(
CORBA
),
object databases
,
and
ORB/ODBMS
integration
.
Now a terminal ("All But Dissertation") PhD student, I'm doing my resarch work
at the
Advanced Computing Lab
of the
Los Alamos National Laboratory
, in the
Sunrise
/
Telemed
project. My PhD dissertation will be entitled
Persistence in
Distributed Object Systems: ORB/ODBMS Integration
.
Before joining Sunrise/Telemed, I did systems software for massively
parallel machines, as a member of the
SUNMOS/Puma
group.




Not an ABD anymore, it is all over now!
Information on my PhD work is available
here
.
