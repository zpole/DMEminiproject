About me...
I'm a graduate student at the University of California at San Diego
in the Computer Science and Engineering Department.
My research interests are in:

/ComputerScience/ArtificialIntelligence/MachineLearning/GeneticAlgorithms
In particular, I'm interested in genetic algorithms containing
models of ontogeny, particularly those in which phrase-structure
grammars are the model of ontogeny of choice.  My work so far
has mainly focused on applying such GA's to the problem of evolving
compare-exchange networks that sort or merge.
More recently, my interests have shifted to broader issues involving
the evolution of grammars, and to other applications of genetic
algorithms containing ontogenetic models.
I am also the current caretaker of GAucsd, a Genetic Algorithm
package maintained locally.

These still need to be filled in the rest of the way.  Sorry for
the inconvenience.
