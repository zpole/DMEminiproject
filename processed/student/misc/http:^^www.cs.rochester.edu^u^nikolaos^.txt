The Best of ARKAS


Some very touching verses (they are in Greek and require Greek fonts)

Ditika tis lipis - apospasma
(West of sadness - Part),
written by Odysseas Elytis. A friend copied this part in a letter addressed to me.
It became my favourite ever since.
Dromologio Deftero
(Second route),
written by Giannaris Hatzimihalis, "Meteikasma", appeared in "Istiaia Agora"
O minas dihos onoma
(The month without name),
written by Giannaris Hatzimihalis, "Menologio", appeared in "Istiaia Agora"

images

An image of a good
friend
