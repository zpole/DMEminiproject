Warning!  I'm trying to update this page so it's pretty messy right
now.
Hi!  I'm Matt.  I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the
Computer Science
program at
UCSD
.  I just returned to my
schoolwork after a nice summer
working at
Encyclopaedia
Britannica
.
I am a recent transplant to
San Diego
from
Raleigh
,
North Carolina
, where
I got my M.S. in
N.C. State
's
Computer Science
program.
Speaking of North Carolina, if you want to help rid the U.S. Senate of
Jesse Helms (doesn't everyone?) send money to
Harvey Gantt
.  He's a pretty good
guy.
My current research interest is connectionist vision and face
recognition.  I am working with
Gary Cottrell
, so I am a
member of
Gary and
Eric's Unbelievable Research Unit (GEURU)
.  I'm not in the group
picture (waahh) but I am a
Geuron
.
Here's some professional-type stuff:
my resume in
html
and
postscript
, and my
master's thesis
(gzipped postscript).
If for some crazy reason you want to know where I am right now, my
schedule
may help.

A few things I like




Surfing
(under construction!).



Veganism
.
You should too!
Why?




The
Volkswagen Bus!









Coffee Shops
.
This SAIC link is broken.  Maybe I'll start my own SD coffee shop
page.  In my spare time, that is.


Live Music
.



.




Chiles!
