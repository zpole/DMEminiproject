"What an incredible country. Crime, corruption, poverty, bad traffic, lousy
economy, no technology, no politeness. Yet, I don't know a single Brazilian
who lives abroad and who doesn't anxiously await the day when he'll return
home. The country grows into you and you become a part of it. No matter how
many problems it has, that place will always be home to me."
(extracted from
Torsten's
home page)







Brazilians are very optimistic, they need reasons for being unhappy, but they
don't need anything for being happy. If a Brazilian looses an eye, he does
not cry for the missing eye, he sings the happiness of seeing with the remaining eye.
Life in Brazil is always full of suffering, but Brazilians do not care.
For them, pain needs some justification, but happiness justifies itself.
