Current Research:

I am adding
speech
input (a speech recognition interface)
to some modules of the
Scientific Reasoning Series (SRS).  The SRS, marketed by IBM, is
highly interactive learning material developed by the Educational
Technology Center, here at UCI.  Currently, all of the SRS requires
keyboard input.  Once speech input is available for some modules of
the SRS, we can perform a summative evaluation with respect to the two
input modes.

Guru Abilities:




Why I'm here at UCI:

To learn how to support good pedagogy with highly interactive,
individualized, computer-based learning materials.
