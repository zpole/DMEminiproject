Robert P. Bland III



Personal Information

I am a graduate student in the department of
computer science
at
Vanderbilt University
.  I will be graduating in May and will begin working for
ISSC
, a subsidiary company of
IBM
.  In 1994 I received my B.A. in mathematics from
Hendrix College
, a small liberal arts school in Conway,
AR
.
My primary interest at Vanderbilt is in Software Engineering.  Specifically, I am intrigued by the effects of the
object-oriented paradigm
on software.  My current M.S. research is on
Sun Microsystem's
new object-oriented language
Java
.  My M.S. paper is titled
"A Translation from C++ to Java."
I am a member of
SDG++
, a weekly discussion group on current topics in Software Engineering.
My hobbies include computers (imagine that!), television, movies, classical music, Billy Joel,
Disney
, travel, and most sports.  I also really enjoy roller coasters.
The Hangman
at Opryland U.S.A. here in Nashville is a great ride!
