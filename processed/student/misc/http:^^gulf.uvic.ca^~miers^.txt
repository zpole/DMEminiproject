Professional
Information

Aside from being a part-time graduate student in
Computer Science, I am also a full-time employee of the
University of Victoria, Computing and Systems Services. I work in
Education Services Group and am
often developing or giving courses in DOS,
Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX applications.
I recently presented a seminar "Creating a
Home Page - A Beginner's Guide". The
slides are available on-line.

Note: I am on study leave, April 1
to September 30, 1996


Current Projects
I am very interested in exploring the Web as a teaching tool. For
a project this term, I have developed the first part of an
interactive tutorial in logic.
CSC 586 Advanced Webology Project

Also, this is a convenient place to put
notes
on my research into adult
learning styles.


Personal
Information

I love opera, classical guitar - I will get back
to playing as soon as I finish graduate studies, and gardening. One of my favorite
web resources for gardening is the
Time Life Complete
Gardener
search page. Finally, just for fun,
I have a virtual tour of my
kitchen
, which makes extensive use of client-side
imagemaps.
