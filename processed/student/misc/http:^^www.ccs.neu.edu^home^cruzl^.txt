SPRAK!  Homepage of Luis Cruz





Welcome to SPRAK!





SPRAK is the official homepage of the entity consisting of a finite amount of
space and mass and goes by the name of Luis Cruz.  If you ever need to find me,
just look for the short man wearing the Duke baseball cap.  I can usually be
found under it.  But what is this SPRAK nonsense???  SPRAK is an acronym that
has befuddled mankind ever since I started using it.  Can you decipher its
meaning?
Currently the author of this page is haunting the hallowed halls of
Northeastern University
I am working towards
a Masters of Science degree in
computer
science
.  If you are in the computer industry or studying computer science,
consider joining the
ACM
.  I received my
Bachelor of Science in computer science from
LeTourneau University.
If I'm not at home, work, or school, you can
probably find me either on a
MBTA train
or
at the
Museum of Fine Arts
.  While crawling
around the web one night, I came across a web page dedicated to a personal
fascination of mine...
