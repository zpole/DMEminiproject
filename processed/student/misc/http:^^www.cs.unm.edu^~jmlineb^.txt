I work at
Sandia National Laboratories
in the
Synthetic Environment Lab
,
doing virtual-reality visualization programming in
C/C++
and
OpenGL
on high-end
Silicon Graphics
(SGI) workstations that have far more main memory that I do.  My professional
interests include software architecture, software engineering,
object-oriented
analysis, design, and programming, and enterprise data modeling.
(In fact, I put myself through college as a data model.)
I am pursuing a Master's degree in the
Computer Science program
at the
University of New Mexico
(UNM) under Sandia's University
Part-Time (UPT) program.  UPT allows me to attend classes and study for 20 hours
a week, work part-time for 20 hours a week, and remain a full-time
Sandia employee.  What a deal!  I am scheduled to graduate in December 1997.
A PhD in Computer Science is in my future, but so is a life ...
I live in Cedar Crest,
New Mexico
, on a ridge at about 7100 feet
with a great view of the east face of the
Sandia mountains
.
I play
classical guitar
,
enjoy
hiking, camping
, and
whitewater canoeing
,
spend far more time hacking
Linux
than I should,
and only date women who run 32-bit operating systems.
I have just started
mountain biking
in order to get swimsuit-compatible for the summer.

And like my mama always told me,

"Nothing feels better against your skin than software."

Quite a lady, my mama ...



Professors and People I Work With



Hear me pronounce my name in
English
or
Spanish
.

Check out the animation of one of my
visualization projects
using
Java
.

Here's great idea for a
radio station
that didn't quite take off,
for some reason.
