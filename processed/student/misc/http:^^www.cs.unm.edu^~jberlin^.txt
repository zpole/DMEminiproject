Janet E. Berlin






Fargo, N. D. Police Dept.







Hello, I'm Janet and this is my wall on the World Wide
Web.  I'm a graduate student in the
Computer Science Department
at the
University of New Mexico
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Right now I just have some interesting links.  I hope to get
my skater boyfriend off his butt and put some artsy stuff up
soon.  Stay tuned.
