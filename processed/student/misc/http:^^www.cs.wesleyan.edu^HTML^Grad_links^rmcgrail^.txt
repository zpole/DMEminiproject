Bob McGrail

(I like Mathematica)

Welcome! I am a graduate student in both the
mathematics
and
computer science
departments at
Wesleyan University
.
My research interests include category theory in computer science,
in particular the categorical semantics of logic programming,
as well as the design of logic programming languages.

I am currently teaching
calculus
at
Wes
and statistics at Middlesex
Community College.

Computer Related Hobbies
In my spare time I like to escape the declarative paradigm and hack away.
I love Quintus Prolog but sometimes I like to get my proverbial hands
dirty elsewhere.  Here are some other environments I use.


Delphi


Visual Basic


Java
