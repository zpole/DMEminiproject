Bethesda's HomePage!!!








Hello and welcome to
Bethesda Thornton's

One of my most memorable experiences was appearing in Ebony Magazine as
Queen of
Shaw
University
:





Here are some of my hobbies:
Listening to Jazz


Being a member of
Zeta Phi
Beta Sorority Inc.






Check out the homepage for the  Zeta's of
Psi Epsilon
Chapter!!!








I am currently a graduate student in the area of
Computer Science.  Although at times life can get hectic,

the  two sites that I enjoy most are those that

take me to
job opportunities
available in
Raleigh, North Carolina
upon graduation.


There are so many different sites to be visited on the Web, these are just a few

that I found quite interesting:


Professional Sites:

What's new with
IBM

What's new with my favorite long distance company,
AT&T!

MCI,
what do you have to offer?

What do
Sprint
and Candice Bergman have to offer?

What's new with the
Fortune 500

Personal Sites:

My favorite sport of all,
Volleyball!!

Are you a
jazz
fan like I am?

Alright for the
Black Information Network!!

Nothing like a good
Soap Opera
in the middle of the day.

Anyone know where I can get a cheap
Airline ticket?

Miscellaneous Sites:

Check out sports on
ESPN

Does anyone love to watch
Figure Skating!
as much as I do?

One of my favorite female comedians is
Roseanne

There's nothing like watching an exhilarating game of
Wheel of Fortune

Hey, do you want to see a TRUE
Indians
fan?
