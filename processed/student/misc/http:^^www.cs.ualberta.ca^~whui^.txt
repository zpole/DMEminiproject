A MSc student in the
CS Department
of
University of Alberta
, Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada.

My unofficial research topic:
Dynamic Reverse Engineering an
Object-Oriented System
.  What is that? It is basically to extract
the design and runtime artifacts of an OO program (Java and C++),
to present it graphically, and to suggest to the users which
objects/subsystems are good
candidates for parallelization.
I am being co-supervised by
Dr. Duane Szafron
and
Dr. Jonathan Schaffer
.


Yet another
graduate
(degree) of
Carleton University
, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Honours Project
:
The SWeb Project
- WWW Server & Client in Smalltalk
Supervisor: Dr. B. N. Freeman-Benson (now at OTI, Victoria, Canada)
