Bill's utterly ridiculous home-page




This homepage undergoing vast renovations!  Stay tuned...
This will
never
be done, to be totally honest...
Here's some graphic.  Actually, this is me, only it's not terribly
recognizable...




Stuff that's interesting
Well, I've been until last year a Computer Science student back at UB
(the University at Buffalo).  Now I'm doing graduate work at
William and Mary
in Williamsburg,
Virginia...
I also work at VIMS, the college's
Virginia Institute of Marine Science
,
in the Computer Center there.
I'm a DJ for a progressive rock radio show called
Sleepless
.
Here's some stuff about satisfying my various
creative urges.
