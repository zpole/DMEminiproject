Research Interests:

groupware, CSCW, telecommuting
I am looking at communication among software development
teams who work in distributed groups.
The distribution of the group may include working in
separate offices as well as working part-time from home.
Communication within the group is by telephone, shared
work space and files, as well as email and face-to-face.
Telecommuting can be defined as working at a distance
and using telecommunications technology to do that
job.  Telecommuting may take place from home or from
another office.  I am also interested in how workers
set up their office space while telecommuting.
