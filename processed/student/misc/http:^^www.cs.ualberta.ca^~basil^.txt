About Myself


I am a graduate student in the
Department of Computing Science
, at the
University of Alberta
(in Alberta, Canada)
working towards my Master's degree.  I previously received my B.Sc. in
Computer Engineering (COOP program) from this university.


Research Activities
My thesis research area is adaptive and evolutionary algorithms (genetic
algorithms, evolutionary strategies).
My supervisor is
Joe Culberson
.
Other areas of interest include the general areas of artificial
intelligence, robotics, and philosophy.  I am particularly interested in
in machine learning, AI in games, autonomous obstacle
avoidance/navigation, and computational/philosophical models of
intelligence.


Personal Hobbies
I have a strong interest, from both a theoretical and a recreational
standpoint, of games in general.  Particular games I am interested in
include the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, and the Hero
roleplaying game.  I am an avid reader of fantasy and science-fiction books.
I also play the piano/keyboard recreationally.
