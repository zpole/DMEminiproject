Ilia's Home Page









You are visitor number
to

Ilia's Home Page

Finally, after much delay, I have hurled myself onto the WWW bandwagon and
created my own
homepage
.

It has taken me a while for several reasons. One of them is I didn't feel
comfortable typing up my autobiography and calling it my home page.
Now, that I got some substance, I have committed myself to creating
this document.
Here is a brief list of things you can find on this page:

Personal stuff

My research and academic interests,
publications

My resume

Sites in Russia

My hobbies


Linux

Photography

Aikido

Pinky and the Brain (Zort!)

Babylon 5


My e-mail address




First, about myself. My name, as follows from the title, is Ilia (pronounced
[Ily'a]), last name is Baldine ([Bahldin]).
There is a story behind this strange spelling, but I'd rather keep it to
myself.
I am a graduate student at the North Carolina State University's
Department of Computer Science
.



Academic interests and publications
My M.S.
thesis
was on multicast routing algorithms. Presently my work is
centered around single-hop optical networks, but I also find interesting
the following areas:

ATM networks.

ATM forum

IP over ATM
resource page


Wireless networks

Network protocols and security


IPng

IETF home page

Directory of RFC


You can find the list of my publications
here
.



Russia
I am Russian, and if you are interested in exploring Russia without leaving
the comfort of your room, this is a good
place
to start. It contains
links to many sites in Russia, plus volumes of information about the history
and the current events in the former Soviet Union. It even has a pointer to
Mikhail Gorbachev's homepage.
Here is a list of other interesting web sites in or about Russia:

Open Media Research Institute
(Affiliated
with Radio Free Europe)

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty

Russia on the Net

Moscow State University
, where I
studied for several years

A mouse-sensitive map
,
which contains pointers to a lot of web sites in Russia





Hobbies




Linux

Linux is a UNIX-like PC operating system. I have a Linux box at home. You
can either see the
specs
for my system, or you can browse a
list
of Linux-related sites.
If you have no idea what Linux is all about but are curious to find out,

Photography
I am something of an amateur photographer. In the past few years I've taken
many many pictures in different parts of this country. I have chosen about
a dozen, that I like a lot, and scanned them in. They fall in two categories:
one that I call
"My Photogallery"
, which is a collection with no
particular theme or order, the other one is from my recent trip to Yellowstone.
Enjoy!

Aikido












I started practicing Aikido in '94 and the more I do it, the more I like it.
With time I will be adding some interesting aikido-related links here. For
now you have a choice of visiting NCSU Aikido Club
home-page
or sending an
e-mail
to the NCSU aikido list, whose subscribers are mostly members of the
aforementioned club.

Pinky and the Brain (Narf!)

I am an avid fan of Spielberg's Animaniacs, in particular -
Pinky and the Brain
. Here are some sites that have images and sounds
from these series:
