I'm now in the Ph.D. program of the
Computer Science Department
of
The Johns Hopkins University
.  I'm in the
Concurrent Systems
Lab
which is in NEB 331A.  I've just finished a research project with
Bob Cypher
on
Graph-Modelling of Fault Tolerant Architectures, a project sponsored in part
by Siemens Corporate Research (Princeton, NJ).  I'm now working on the
design of Buffer Reservation Algorithms for arbitrary graphs.


Academic Background
I attended the University Primary School in Legon (at the University of
Ghana, Legon), and went on to the Achimota Secondary School.  I obtained a
BSc. in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Ghana, Legon.
