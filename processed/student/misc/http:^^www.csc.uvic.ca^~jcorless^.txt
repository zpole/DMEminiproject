About Me



I am a graduate student at the
University of Victoria
in Victoria, British Columbia ( which, btw is
a really cool place to live -- did I mention that we have the best
weather in Canada?  Well, we do!).
I am in the department of
Computer Science
, and my supervisor is
Dr. Nigel Horspool
.  My research interests currently include Data
Compression, Concurrent Programming, and Java.
My hobbies include : skiing, tennis, squash, hiking, softball, and hockey.



Things I think are cool









Linux is definately the coolest "free" thing around!  If you don't
have it, you should
get it.







I've recently installed FreeBSD on my primary workstation, and find it to
be excellent.  Both Linux and FreeBSD have their advantages, but I think
I'd use FreeBSD as a "server" platform, since the networking seems to
be more stable.








Java related projects I've been working on


An applet that draws Bezier line segments

Playing around with concurrency and Java monitors

An applet for playing Chess

A Java interpreter for inclusion in the Kaffe system

A compression program for Java class files












I am currently doing consulting work for
Teleserve Canada Inc.

I do the network administration and some custom programming for our
voice mail server.  This summer I wrote a application which allows our
customers to have their internet e-mail transfered into their voice mailbox.
