Wow, you're the visitor no
since November 14, 1996.



Welcome to my home page.

I am a first year graduate student at Johns Hopkins University.
I don't look like in the previous picture. To be honest, I don't have any
intention to.

If I had had more spare time, I would have figured out
by now which are my research interests. Probably they'll come a little
later, together  with the rest. Anyway, I did waste my time studying:


Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence

Speech Recognition

It seems that I'm switching to NLP


Because I have to do something to justify my existence,
I am the TA for the Object Oriented System Course  (goto
Object
Oriented Systems page
) .
