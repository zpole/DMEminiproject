Ephemeral quote
The Economist, summing up the results of
voting on 1996 ballot propositions:
Money's usefulness apart, the moral of 1996 is clear:
if you are a white male who wants to work for the
minimum wage, bilk small investors and smoke joints when you're ill,
California is the place to be.


Research
I'm a 4th year PhD student working with Professor T.C. Hu on combinatorial algorithms.
Some of my other research interests are
a machine learning
technique for
time series analysis
, and
market mechanisms
for distributed resource allocation.

Administration
I run the
CSE copy coop
, a way for grad students to get access to
copy machines in the building.  Check it out.

Affiliations
Prior to coming to UCSD for graduate study I lived in Japan for over two
years, studying Japanese and supporting myself by working for
Urban
Translation
as an editor and apprentice translator.  I still do a little
work for them occasionally, and am glad to see their multimedia and
web-related business is growing.

Curiosities
When I'm not studying or surfing (in the ocean--not "web grazing"),
I'm an avid reader (and
an enemy of
television
).  I'm starting to
collect a
list of  reading material
that I've enjoyed
lately, including some comments and quotations.


Anyone can be an
inventor
.
