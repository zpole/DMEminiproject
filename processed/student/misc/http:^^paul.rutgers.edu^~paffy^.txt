Before I graduate, these pages will be moved to

I am taking
classes
towards my Masters in
Computer
Science at
Rutgers
.
I intend to finish in 1997.
Since I am now also working in RUCS, I no longer need to look for a
job
.
To see my work history, please take a look at my
resume
.
A hard copy, not html formatted, can be fax'ed upon request.
Wish I had more time to
goof off
...
Most of my pages are textual,
since I usually access the web from a textual browser.
(Do you want to know about my good intentions regarding my
PC
?)
However with some help my
friends
and a bit of peer pressure,
there are a few pictures which one could try to recognize me from:
My favorite ones are from Yosemite:
1996
and
pre grad school
(taken by
Chuck Fry
).
Dave Katinsky
took this
picture
in his former cube.
Owen Delong
fixed up the
color
on it.
Rodney Chin
took this
shot
.
Feel free to look at some of the
book marks
I have collected.
