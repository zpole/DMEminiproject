Research Interests


Concurrency Theory
Most of my research has been in testing theory for real-time systems.
More recently I have been working on testing equivalences for Pict, a
concurrent object-oriented language based on the pi-calculus.
Model-checking for Real-time and Probabilistic Systems

Scheduling Theory
While this is not something I am actively studying as part of my thesis
research,
I did spend the summer of 1996 working at
Rome Laboratory
doing research in this area.


Personal:
This seems to be the section where everyone mentions the far-away places
that they call home. Well
I'm a native Baltimorean so obviously I didn't stray too far from home
when I chose JHU. I actually grew up in Linthicum (12 miles to the south,
where the airport is).
My high school,
Archbishop Spalding H.S.
, has its own homepage.
I managed to get a little farther away from home for college.
I graduated in 1991 from
Randolph-Macon College
in Ashland, Virginia with a degree in
Computer Science
and
Mathematics
.
