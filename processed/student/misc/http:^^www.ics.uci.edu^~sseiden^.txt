Research

Right now, I'm interested in
randomized online algorithms
.
Other interests include

Advanced compiler-compiler tools,
O(1) space tree traversal,
Minimal perfect hashing,
Anything involving the use of simultaneous equations over finite fields.

Here is my
Curriculum vitae
.



Abilities

I've programmed in C, C++, Pascal, Ada, Lisp and various assembly languages.
Tools which I've used a lot include Mathematica, TeX, LaTeX, Yacc, and Lex.
I've worked on a commercial Pascal compiler, so I know
things that no one should about Pascal.
I know a little about Tcl/Tk and HTML.



Theoretical Computer Science Cheat Sheet

This consists of ten pages of commonly used formulas and other useful information for computer scientists. I don't guarantee it to be error free,
however,
if you report an error to me by email I'll attempt to correct it as soon as possible.
A
PostScript version
is available or you can get the TeX source as a
compressed tar archive
.
Be forewarned that the TeX source is quite messy.
Any suggestions from TeXperts on cleaning it up are welcome.
The program dviconcat is required to typeset the sheet.
