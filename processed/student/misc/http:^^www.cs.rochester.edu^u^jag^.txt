Outdoor adventures

Exploring the backcountry in the US and Sweden

Älvkullegymnasiet
After high school I went to
Chalmers
which is located in the
city of Gothenburg
on

At Chalmers I studied Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science, with
special interest in computational physics, numerical analysis/optimization,
and machine vision.
Now in
Rochester
