Hi,
My name is Dean Mah.  And unfortunately, I'm far from a child prodigy....
Here's a more recent picture of
me
when I'm all
growed up.  By including this picture, I am in no way implying that I actually
like it -- the picture or being a grown up!  :P
I am currently (of '94-'95) enrolled at the
University of Alberta
studying
Computer Science
towards a
Master's Degree under the supervision of
Dr. Mark Green
.
I've just recently moved from
MacKenzie Hall
a part of
Lister Hall
which is the main undergraduate residences.  Now I live in
Hub Mall
but my office is in
GSB
.

And finally I love living in Canada, a country where,

The weak and nerdy
are admired for their computer programming ability.
