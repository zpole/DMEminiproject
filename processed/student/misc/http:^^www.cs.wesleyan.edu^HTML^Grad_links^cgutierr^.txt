They are playing a game. They are playing at not playing a game.
If I show them I see they are,
I shall break the rules and they will punish me.
I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game. --R. D. Laing

About myself and mine



Let me have my own way,
Let others promulge the laws, I will make no account of the laws,
Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace,
I hold up agitation and conflict,
I praise no eminent man, I rebuke to his face the one that was thought most
worthy.
--After I wrote this lines,
I realized that I was plagiarized 136 years ago by W. Whitman.


Coming soon: useful links to peyote, alcohol, tobacco, sex and other
