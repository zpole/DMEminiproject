Preeti Ranjan Panda - WWW Home Page



Greetings from
Preeti Ranjan Panda
Namashkaar!

Page Status: UCI (Under Construction Indefinitely)





Academic
I am a student at the
University of California, Irvine
,
located in Southern California, USA, 80 km south of
Los Angeles
.
I am pursuing a PhD degree at the
Dept of Computer Science
. UC Irvine forms part of the nine campus
University of California
system, and is the
most beautiful of them all!





Music


I am a frequent visitor to the Rec.Music.Indian.Misc (RMIM) newsgroup.
The
Hindi Film Music
home page maintained by Sami Mohammed, is a gateway
to a great collection of interesting and informative articles about Indian
Music posted on the newsgroup.


ITRANS Songbook
is a wonderful repository of Indian Film songs/poetry
in Hindi and other languages.

When I am not listening to Hindi songs, I sniff
Western Classical
music.





Chess


I am a Chess patzer. I keep lots of chess books without reading them, and
lots of links to chess pages without following them. The
Internet Chess Library
has lots of interesting stuff about chess, for patzers and masters
alike. The
Chess Art Gallery
has some cute pictures of weird chess sets and
weird chess champions.

Weekly updates of Chess events around the world are provided by
Mark
Crowther
in UK.





My Friends


Desi Grad Students at UC Irvine
are few and far between. Even fewer
have the time and inclination to create web pages.


Jamuna Hostel
in
IIT-Madras
is the most cool and prestigious hostel in India. Check out some of my
classmates from the
B.Tech Class of '90, Computer Science
batch.





My Background


I belong to
India
, the land featuring the
world
's oldest continuous civilization
and the world's largest democracy.

I was raised in Berhampur, a small town
in the state of Orissa, in the eastern coast of India. Orissa is dotted
with thousands of ancient, majestic temples, such as
the
Sun Temple at Konark
,
the
Mukteswar Temple  at Bhubaneswar
and
the
Jagannath Temple at Puri
, all centuries old and
featuring brilliantly intricate architecture.

My ultimate destination is the city of
Bangalore
, the Silicon Valley of India, the city that
boasts the world's highest per capita IQ - where opportunity knocks
on your door multiple times and patiently awaits your response.
