Research Projects:

IRIS:
INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND INFORMATION SERVICES

My research interests focus on the ways in which organizations use
online information (OI) resources.  My pilot research suggests that
OI resources may play an important role in the formation and maintenance
of interorganizational relationships.  The main objective
of my current research is to analyze how interorganizational relationships
are mediated through OI resource use.  My case study will
describe the social processes of online information mediation by
identifying the roles of intermediaries and the patterns of mediation
which occur when OI resources, and other resources such as paper-based media
and personal contacts, are used intensively by organizations in the
corporate sector.
Our Cooperating Organization on the IRIS Project is
Knight-Ridder Information.


Guru Abilities:


Relational Databases and Client/Server technology implementation
Software Architecture transition strategies
Heterogeneous object technology integration in commercial software
(Doesn't this sound awful?  Well, the net result of this is that I'm
excellent in C, C++ and SQL.  And I have wonderful war stories about
trying to get multiple clients to work with multiple servers in widely
distributed client/server configurations.)
