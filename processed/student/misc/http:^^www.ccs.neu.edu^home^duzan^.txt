Gary Duzan

a.k.a. Tall Pale Stranger






The above are from my student id and driver's license, respectively,
since that's all I had handy at the time. They suffice for a rough
approximation of my appearance.
I'm often on
ISCA BBS
,
so you could look for me there. Or send me mail. My main address is
gary@wheel.tiac.net
,
but you could also send it to
duzan@ccs.neu.edu
.
I'll be looking for work starting in early '97. If you have a challenging
position available in Object-Oriented or Systems Software
Development, please check out my resume in
text
or
PostScript
format.
For all sorts of strange insights into my personality,
finger duzan@ccs.neu.edu
.
(It is a little slow at times, so be patient.)
My home machine, wheel.tiac.net, runs
NetBSD
,
a free Berkeley-derived OS, and connects to the net via
TIAC
,
The Internet Access Company, using PPP over a Motorola Power 28.8
modem.
Since DUZAN is such a rare name, its origins have always interested
me. Take a look at the
GEDCOM Database
of the genealogical data that I've collected. Most comes from other
DUZAN researchers, most notably Doug Duzan and Mary Duzan Hawley,
but I've added what I could, including my own branch of the family.
The database currently contains 4095 people, 1501 families, and is
about 530K of ASCII text.
