Grand Cayman Trip

The photo to the right was taken with an SGI camera, since I don't
have a recent one in any other format. Needless to say this picture
is old now, the job search has resulted in getting my hair cut (1/4/96).
If I ever find some time I will put a picture of the "new" me on the net.
Although that might be a while since I don't particularly like the "new"
look.
