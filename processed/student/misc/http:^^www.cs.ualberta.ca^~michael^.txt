Michael Boshra




Welcome to my web page, please make yourself at home.
I am a Ph.D. student at the
Department of Computing Science
,
University of Alberta
. The U of A is located in
Edmonton
, the capital of the Province of
Alberta
, Canada.

My life in Edmonton is really
cool
, especially during the Winter. Here, I am living by
the
C
and enjoying the
SUN
. I hope this fortune to continue, perhaps with a little bit change in the semantics:)
