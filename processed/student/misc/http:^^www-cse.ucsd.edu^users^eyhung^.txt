"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before"

-- Edgar Allan Poe



Who am I?
I am a second-year doctoral student at the
University of California at San Diego
in the department of
Computer Science and Engineering
.
I received my high school diploma from
Torrey Pines High School
,
and my undergraduate degree in
EECS
from
UC Berkeley
.
While at Berkeley I worked for two student organizations:
Eta Kappa Nu
(EECS Honor Society) and
UCSEE
(Student IEEE Society).
I am currently sitting in the UCSD
Computer Systems Laboratory
which is run by Professors
Joseph Pasquale
and
George Polyzos
.

How charged with punishments the scroll:

And the end of all our exploring

And know the place for the first time."

"There are three kinds of death in this world.  There's heart death,
there's brain death, and there's being off the network."

-- Guy Almes



Computers!
Being a CS student, I naturally have many interests related to computers.
These run the gamut from
Java
programming
and
RFC
reading
to practicing geekspeak(via the
Jargon File
).  And,
of course, a link for what got me interested in computers in the first
place:
games
!



"If addiction is judged by how long a dumb animal will sit
pressing a lever to get a 'fix' of something, to its own detriment, then
I would conclude that netnews is far more addictive than cocaine."

-- Rob Stampfli



News and info:
I'm an avid devourer of news and information, and maintain an active
interest in what's happening around the world.  In addition to regular
news, I am also a USENET addict, reading over 60 newsgroups daily (though
down from a high of 120+, since the signal-to-noise ratio has been
declining considerably of late).

"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."

-- William Butler Yeats

"We are the music makers,
And we are the dreamers of dreams.
Wandering by lone sea breakers,
And sitting by desolate streams;

World-losers and world-forsakers,
On whom the pale moon gleams:
Yet we are the movers and shakers
Of the world forever, it seems."

-- Arthur O'Shaughnessy
