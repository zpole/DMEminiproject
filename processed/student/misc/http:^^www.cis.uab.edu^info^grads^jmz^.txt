Research
Presently, I am working on a Master's thesis entitled
An Environment
to Reconstruct Surfaces from Contour Data
under the guidance of
Professor Kenneth Sloan and Professor John Johnstone. The software I
am developing is meant to be extremely portable and extensible. I
hope to be able to extend it to work with other data situations, mainly
scattered data and multiple orthogonal contours. When I get the
wherewithall, I will place the proposal online.

Here
is my first
real
Java program.
I did this for my Computer Graphics II project. (Hint: This version has
an error. Can you find it?)

Personal
When I'm not transfixed to a computer or research article, I spend time
reading, role-playing, playing the guitar, and hanging out with my wife,
Lori, and
our beautiful daughter, Hannah. We are expecting another child in
August.
Here are some
useful bookmarks
. Send me some
email if you have a site I might be interested in.
Here are some inane attempts at self-categorization.
