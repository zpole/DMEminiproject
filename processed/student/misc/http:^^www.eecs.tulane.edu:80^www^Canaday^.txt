My own private Island.


Matthew R. Canaday

PhD Student

Tulane University, New Orleans, LA

My current work is focussed almost exclusively on my dissertation.

I am researching
and constructing a neurally plausible model of the human visual motion perception system.
It encorporates several different fields, from my undergraduate work in physiological psychology,
my work at NYU's Department of Physiology and Biophysics, and my computer science work
here at
Tulane
.

Perhaps this needs a little more explanation:


Neurally Plausible

The model is based on research in physiology and
theories
of early vision.

Human Visual Motion

This model has as its motivation the exploration of theories of human psychophysics, primarily
the phenomenon of equiluminant motion perception.

Perception

Perception, a opposed to detection, poses an intriguing question of the interactions between
receptors in early vision and the assignment of meaning at later stages in the human visual system.


Obviously, there is a whole lot more to it...


but now for something completely different!

...note that I did say my work is
almost
exclusively focussed on dissertation...

My other interests include:


My Fiancee Melanie :-)!
Nature
(trees, mountains, grasses, the ocean...)

Motorcycles
(I own a Honda Transalp XL600V)

Role-Playing Games
(currently running a Blade-Runner-based Cyberpunk campaign)

Music (Alternative, Classic Rock, Classical)
Books (Science Fiction, Fantasy)
Travel
(to almost anywhere for almost any reason!)

If you have an interest in
Computer Vision
,
Neuroscience
, or any of
the above (excluding Melanie!), feel free to write to me.  My e-mail address is:

Have a fabulous day!
