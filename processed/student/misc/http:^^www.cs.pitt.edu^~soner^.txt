Area: Computer Architecture and Programming Languages

Interests:


Architecture:


I am very much intrigued by the idea that you can bring common
building blocks (say bricks if you will) in more ways than any
of us can imagine. I call the way this is done
architecture
.
If I had lived earlier, many years before the mankind invented
computers, I sure would want to work with and learn from my favorite
architect Mimar Sinan and build mosques, bridges, and houses.
However, I now shuffle imaginary components around, trying to come
up with an execution paradigm which is simple in concept, easy
to implement but in no way as dull as a solid brick wall. I am
after elegance, one which is useful. This is what I call
computer
architecture
, I now work on with my supervisor
Rajiv Gupta
.



Computer architecture:


In order to sort through a zillion bad ideas and find the few
which are good, I thought it would be easier if I could design
and develop a tool that can be used to define a Computer
Architecture at the RTL level and obtain the assembler, and
the simulator for the architecture automatically. The result
was UPFAST (University of Pittsburgh Flexible
Architecture Simulation Tool). I'm currently implementing
UPFAST.
I am using UPFAST to simulate my novel idea that I call
Data Forwarding
, which is outlined in my
proposal
.
I have designed computer architectures which are different
implementations of the data forwarding idea.
They are described in my
publications
.



Computer languages:


I consider computer languages and compiler technology inseparable
parts of Computer Architecture research. I speak all but lisp,
prolog and a couple other languages.
I used to program using ALGOL (the father of your favorite C) but
nobody remembers this language any more. Nobody seems to remember
what reliability, predictability, and reproducibility of errors
mean either.
My favorite operating system is NOT Unix, and it is NOT produced
by Microsoft. In the absence of it, I use Linux (at home and
at work) and like it.
