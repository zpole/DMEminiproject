Welcome to my home page.
Please have fun browsing these pages. I have placed information about myself,
my research
, and my life here for your enjoyment.

Please give me feedback!





I am a graduate student in the software program of the
Department of Information and Computer Science
at the
University of California, Irvine
. I have been at UCI since 1986. I spent four years here as an undergraduate, earning my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 1990. I have spent the remaining six years as a graduate student. I received my Master of Science degree in Computer Science in 1992, and I am now about a year away from receiving my Doctor of Philosophy degree in Computer Science.
