Research


I am currently persuing my
Ph.D.
in Computing Science at the
University of Alberta
, researching learning and computation in
connectionist
(or "neural") networks
.  I am jointly supervised by
Dr. T. Anthony Marsland
,
Department of Computing Science
and
Dr Michael R.W.
Dawson
,
Department of Psychology
(Adjunct appointment, Computing Science).
I work in the
Biological
Computation Project
, an interdisciplinary lab coordinated by Dr. Michael
Dawson, bringing together researchers from Computing Science, Psychology and
Philosophy.  I am also associated with the
Artificial
Intelligence Research Group
in the Department of Computing Science and
am a member of the
International Neural
Network Society
.

Areas of interest guiding my work include:


Connectionist systems and biologically inspired models of computation
Operations research & Markov processes, esp. with regard to probabilistic
learning
Artificial Intelligence
