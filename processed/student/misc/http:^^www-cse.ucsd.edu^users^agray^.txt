I am a masters student working in the
Software Evolution group
at UCSD on automated techniques to assist the maintenance, understanding,
and restructuring of large software systems.  Specifically, I am
investigating the adaptation of an existing object-oriented restructuring
tool for C programs to a generic tool capable of being retargeted to
restructure Ada programs.  More details about my research can be found in my
thesis proposal
.
In my other life, I am a software engineer for
ACCEL Technologies, Inc.
,
an industry leader in the Electronic Design Automation software
market since 1986.  ACCEL develops and supports
ACCEL EDA
,
a powerful suite of electronic design software tools for the Windows
platform.  ACCEL also offers the mature and flexible
Tango
,
an easy-to-use entry-level design environment for DOS.
