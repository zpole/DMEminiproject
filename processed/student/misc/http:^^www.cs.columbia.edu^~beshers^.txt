is a real-time, 3D, interactive visualization
system for exploring multivariate functions.

AutoVisual
is a
rule-based system that designs
n
-Vision visualizations.
Together, they comprise my thesis work.

In the past, I worked on FourSight, a system that displayed
four-dimensional objects on a 3D graphics workstation in real time.  I
used Gouraud shading to implement 4D depth cueing: bright parts
are closer in 4-space, dark parts are further away.  Follow this link
