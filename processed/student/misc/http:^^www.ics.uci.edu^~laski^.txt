"Are
you
threatening
me?"



Professional Interests

Formal
methods
in software analysis, verification and testing; quality assurance and software
metrics (no, I really
don't
know what I'm talking about)...

Projects

None as of yet,
but I tingle at the very thought...

Miscellany

Visit
my
WACKY
(yet family-friendly in more ways that one)
Picture
Gallery
!

Here
are
a few other Web sites
worth looking at...

I do plan to add more
mundane stuff here (and waste precious disk space), so do come back often.
