Who am I?


Computer Science and Engineering
PhD student

My
current schedule
is available in PostScript
form.

I came to UCSD from the
University
of Rochester

Computer Science
Department
, where I was working on a project overseen by
Andrew
Mccallum

a Virtual Reality system based on SGI's Performer Libraries.

My office hours are 12:00 - 13:00 TuTh in AP&M 3337A.

My constantly updated, but highly worthless home page is available
