Emersons' Law of Contrariness:

Having found them, we shall then hate them for it.

or, of course, you could just read

Just in case you didn't notice, I'm reorganizing this page... bear

Hello, and welcome to my home page, located in
sunny
downtown
Baltimore

Maryland
.
Thank you,
thank you.
Up until very recently, this page was located in the rather revolting
city of Newark,
New
Jersey
, which is not only the the car
theft
capital
of the eastern seaboard, but now (as of this year) the
murder
capital
of America.  I must confess to a certain perverse pride in that fact...

"So, (I hear you ask), how did you manage to extricate yourself from that
wonderful 3-ring circus of a city?"  Well, you see,
it

I usually use the Sun box that some call
"
Osprey
" (but I call "
Walrus
") on campus, and
you can
finger
me there
to see if I'm around.
Anyway, This being the
World Wide
Web
and all, I guess I am supposed to give you a whole load of
details about my life with a slew of more-or-less on-topic links to
hither and yon.
So... without further ado:



Me, myself, and I



Weird jobs I have held

I have been a puppeteer, makeup artist, cinematographer,
projectionist, Steadicam operator, and occasional Groucho Marx
impersonator in Woody Allen plays.  Ain't life fun?

neighbor and the the Baltimore
Shabbat Clock
.










Computer Stuff:





Books





Music







Last, but not least, fun places to visit!


I hereby decree that the
