Pascale FUNG


PhD candidate

I am currently a PhD candidate in
Computer Science
at
Columbia
University
. I received my MSc in Computer Science from Columbia in 1993
and my BS in Electrical Engineering from
Worcester
Polytechnic Institute
in Massachusetts in 1988.
I have been a research
affiliate with
AT&T Bell Laboratories
(Murray Hill, New Jersey) since 1993. I was a teaching faculty at the
Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering
of the
Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology
.
During 1991-1992, I was associate scientist at
BBN Systems & Technologies
(Cambridge, Mass.), participating
in the design and implementation of the BYBLOS speech recognition system.
I was a visiting researcher at
LIMSI, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique
(France) in
1991. From 1989-1991, I was a research student in the
Department of Information Science, Kyoto University
(Japan).
Prior to that, I was a visiting researcher at
Ecole Centrale Paris
(France).

Research interests:
Statistical machine translation and natural language processing; speech
processing; speech recognition; speaker adaptation; pattern recognition;
signal processing.
