Hi there! My name is Atanas Rountev, but people call me Nasko. I am a Ph.D. student in the
Department of Computer Science
at
Rutgers University
.
I am
interested in programming languages and compilers. You better check
out the
PROLANGS
home page.

My home country is Bulgaria. Click
here
to learn more about it.

By the way, this page is
not
under construction (just kidding).
