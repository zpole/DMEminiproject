Giuseppe Sena's Home Page


Welcome to Giuseppe Sena's (Tony) Web Page




The first thing you need to know about me is that everybody calls me
Tony
. I am a Ph.D. student in the
College of Computer Science
at
Northeastern University
. As a good
Italian I love
Futbol
(or what Americans call
Soccer
),
and if you love futbol as I do you'll find
these links
pretty cool. Of course, if you ask me I would say
that the best futbol player in the world is
Roberto Baggio
.
If you want, you can get
more
information
about me or you can see some
family pictures
