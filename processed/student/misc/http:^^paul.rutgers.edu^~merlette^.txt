Hello there!
My name is
Darryle Merlette and I am a PhD
student in
Computer Science
at Rutgers University
.
My research interests are in
Artificial Intelligence
because I feel there is too much
Natural Stupidity
in the world!
You can find out about the
Stock Market Data Mining Project
that I worked on (Fall 1994) if you wish, but I can't guarantee
the sanity, consistency, or recency of the links and data. More recently I've
been working on the compression of DNA sequence data and
connectionist natural language generation (can you tell
I'm undecided about where exactly to focus my research?).
Ahhh, the joys of infinite search space!
I have a B.S.E in Computer Science from
Princeton University
and a M.S.E in Computer Science and Engineering from the
University of Michigan
.
I've spent 6 years as a Software Engineer at
Bell Communications Research
(Bellcore)
and am currently a Software Development Consultant
with Advanced Information Solutions.



Would you like to play a game?

Perhaps you'd like to view
my photo album.
(WARNING: Contains graphically
adorable baby pictures!)
Whip me, beat me, spank me ... make me write bad checks! Okay, until
an appropriate input device allows this, I'll settle for
some
e-mail
.
I just love pithy, provocative, and often humorous quotes. Check out
my ever-expanding
Wall O' Quotations
if you do too!
I also serve on the board of the
Association of
Black Princeton Alumni (ABPA).
