I am a Ph.D. Student in the
Computer
Science Department
at the
University
of California, Riverside
.  My
Resume
will tell you where else I've been and what I've done with my life so far.
My research is aimed at developing an autonomous
intelligent planning system
for near-optimal use of limited
resources, when
a priori
resource-use information is unreliable
or unknown.  My thesis advisor is
Dr. Jay Farrell
,
assistant professor of
electrical engineering
.  Possible applications of our intelligent
planning system include hybrid / electric vehicles such as those
developed at
CE-CERT
,
within the
College of Engineering
.
I spend my free time listening to music, playing volleyball,
hiking
up any of the surrounding mountains, or playing soccer on the
CS intramural soccer team
,
(a.k.a. the Nondeterministic Scoring Machine) which I helped organize.
