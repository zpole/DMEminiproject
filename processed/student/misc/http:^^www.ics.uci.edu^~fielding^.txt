Research Projects

I am a member of the
Arcadia
and
Hyperware
projects doing research on
next-generation software engineering environments.  My particular emphasis
is on
global software engineering environments
,
using the Web as a medium for international collaboration.
I have been actively involved in the World Wide Web project for over
three years now.  I set up the original
ICS Department's WWW server
in 1993,
created several
WWW software packages
,
and then became involved in the effort to specify and improve the WWW
infrastructure (the set of protocols that you used to retrieve and view
this document) through the
IETF
working
groups on
URI
,
HTML
,
and
HTTP
.
I am also one of the founding members of the
Apache Group
, creators of the Apache
HTTP server that currently dominates the general-purpose server market.
Apache is my favorite example of the power of global collaboration for the
creation of software.
During the summer of 1995, I was a Visiting Scholar at MIT/LCS, working with
Tim Berners-Lee and the
World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C)
.  You can also see my
W3C Home

Maintaining Distributed Hypertext Infostructures:
Welcome to MOMspider's Web

First International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW94)
,
Geneva, Switzerland, May 25-27, 1994.  An updated version is published in
Computer Networks and ISDN Systems

Freely-Available Software


libwww-perl

A library of Perl4 packages which provides a simple and consistent
programming interface to the World Wide Web.  This library is being
developed as a collaborative effort to assist the further development
of useful WWW clients and tools.
MOMspider

A web robot for providing multi-owner maintenance of
distributed hypertext infostructures.
wwwstat

A package for analyzing httpd server access logs and providing
summary statistics in HTML format.
Apache

The best general-purpose HTTP server that money can't buy.

Life Story
What, you're still reading this?  According to most hypertext research,
you should have become bored by now and moved on to to another page.
Well, this is for those who are extra curious (or just have nothing better
to do).
My background is a bit odd: I was conceived in
New Zealand
and born in
South Laguna
,
California
.
Although most of my schooling has been in the U.S., I was taught how
to read during a year in
Auckland
.
My
father
is an emeritus professor in
Social Sciences
here at UC Irvine,
which is why I have been raised a Yank.  I was born in September 1965,
during the first week of classes of the year UCI was established, so you
might say that the two of us grew up together.  I am part
Maori
,
Kiwi
,
Yank, Irish, Scottish, British, and California beach bum.  Like I
said, a bit odd.
Most of the rest can be seen in my
vita
.
Other Interests
I like playing games -- especially non-betting card games (Bridge,
Hearts, etc) and obscure board games (british rails, naval war, etc).
I also like playing basketball, softball, football and going fishing.
Mind you, I haven't had time to do any of these things since I started
messing with the Web.
Quotations

What is life?  It is the flash of a firefly in the night.
It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime.
It is the little shadow which runs across the grass
and loses itself in the sunset.

--- Crowfoot's last words (1890), Blackfoot warrior and orator.


To most readers it will be easy, after reading this tale, to accept
Rover's theory that Man is set up deliberately as the antithesis of
everything the Dogs stand for, a sort of mythical straw-man, a
sociological fable.
This is underlined by the recurring evidence of Man's aimlessness,
his constant running hither and yon, his grasping at a way of life
which constantly eludes him, possibly because he never knows exactly
what he wants.

--- Clifford D. Simak, "City" [Notes on the Fifth Tale], 1952.


If I had 2 cents for every time someone offered me their $0.02,
writing IETF standards would be downright profitable.
