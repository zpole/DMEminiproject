Who is Craig Lanzen?
Hi, my full name is Craig Andrew Lanzen.  I was born and raised
in Toledo, Ohio.  Currently, I am studying computer science as a
graduate student here at Bowling Green State University.  I will
graduate with a Master's Degree on May 11th, 1996.  I am engaged
to be married to Jennifer Lynn Lammers who is an undergraduate
here studying Marine Biology.  She will graduate with me and two
weeks later we'll get married and moving to North Carolina
where we'll have jobs waiting for us.
