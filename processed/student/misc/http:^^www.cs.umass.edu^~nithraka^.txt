Life, Universe and Everything




Who am i ?

I am a grad student at the
Dept. of Computer Science
at
UMass
,
Amherst
. After
having a great time at
Sishya
, I
decided to get "serious" and landed up at the
Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras
. They let me out with a B.Tech in Computer
Science and so here I am pursuing graduate studies. I belong to the
Godav Class 0f 95
. Life is too short to say Nithrakashyap everytime u refer to me
... so it was truncated to Nitro. As u might have guessed, I'm pretty
explosive stuff !

What am I working on ?

I am presently working with the
LASER group
. I am looking at concurrency control issues for
Pleiades
, an
object management system. In particular, I am looking at ways to
provide support for co-operation in software engineering
environments. I am also working on consistency management issues in
the context of software engineering. I currently have only one
publication


Other interests

Well, apart from computers, I am really interested in music
and if you share my interest, you might be interested in checking
my music
page
out ...

Being a CS grad student, I obviously spend most of my
time surfing the internet with good ol' Netscape. I shall refrain from
providing any hot links since there are millions of other pages that
do.

I love travelling and have
done my share of it since landing in this country. Of course it helps
to have
friends
conveniently distributed around the US.

I follow the fortunes of the Minutemen who managed to
reach the Final Four this year. (Is it a coincidence that my first
year at Umass is their best year yet ?).

Go ahead ! Send me mail !
