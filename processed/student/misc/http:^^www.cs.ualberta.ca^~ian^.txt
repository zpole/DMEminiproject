I'm a PhD candidate at the department of
Computing Science
here at the
University of Alberta
.  The cartoon, done by one of the
members
of our
asylum
,
will give you an idea of my
work environment.  I won't say if it is a good or bad idea :)  Click on
the image to get a larger version of the cartoon. BTW, I'm the one on
the couch.
My supervisors are:
Jonathan Schaeffer
and
Duane Szafron

I started the PhD program in January of 1993.  My topic is
parallel I/O templates in a distributed memory programming environment.
To contact me, use the letter icon to email me.  Otherwise,
here's my
address
.
As part of my research program, I am involved in the
Enterprise
project which is part of the
Parallel Programming Systems Laboratory.

I am also working for
CNS
(Computing and Network Services) in the Research Computing Support Group.
My duties include system administration, support and consulting for the
supercomputing users in campus. Our systems include an IBM
SP2
parallel computer, a
workstation farm
for numeric intensive problems and several RS/6000 boxes used in
distributed applications.
I was the 1995-1996 Computing Science Graduate Student Association
(CSGSA)
President.  Here is the
Graduate Student Association
