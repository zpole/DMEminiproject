Department of Computing Science
,
University of Alberta
.  I
completed my masters in 1995 from
University
of Saskatchewan
where I worked with
Dr. Eric Neufeld.




Curriculum Vitae


Publications

M.Sc. Research
My thesis
research focussed on
unsupervised classification
(the
cognitive ability to classify without any help from an omniscient
supervisor). Other research projects that I worked on during my MSc
included the Natural Language Processing Project as well as performing
a comparison of inferring causal theories from data.
Ph.D. Research
My
work with the classification problem has shown that it, like so many
other problems in AI, is intractable. It seems optimal solutions for
the tasks such as pattern recognition, classification and learning are
intractable to perform on a serial computer. While understanding the
nature of learning continues to be my goal, I want to study the
cognitive processes involved in human learning in the hope of uncovering the
computational principles that enable humans to perform these tasks in real
time.
