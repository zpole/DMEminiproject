You reached Mihaela ...



I'm a PhD student in computer science at
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque
. My hometown is
Timisoara
, located in the western part of
Romania
. The page about Timisoara is rather slow to load, but it has some pictures to help anyone  get a feel about the architecture. And because I was asked often enough, romanians speak a latin-based language, Romanian.
The major points of my professional trajectory:

M.D. from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Timisoara, Romania.

Development of computational models for the immune system as part of theoretical immunology programs of the
Santa Fe Institute
and Los Alamos National Laboratory. These programs are directed by Alan Perelson.

Currently working on my PhD, with
Stephanie Forrest
.


My research interests revolve around


theoretical immunology
: the focus of the models that I work with is the B cell immune response, both in terms of antibody production and development of memory.


cognitive science
: I am exploring a model of concept acquisition based on
self-organizing maps.


complex systems
