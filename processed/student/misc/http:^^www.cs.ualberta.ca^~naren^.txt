Areas of Involvement

Currently I am working on a project to develop intelligent support
for software evolution. More details will be filled in later.

Research Interests

Software Engineering; Application of Artificial Intelligence in
software engineering; Formal aspects of software engineering and
software evolution processes.

Education

Information about educational background.  Options here would include
links to Thesis abstracts, or even to the complete Thesis text, links
to archives of thesis-developed software, etc.  A link to the WWW
server of the school/department that a degree is from is another good
idea.

M.C.A. Computing Science 1986,

Personal Information

A complete resume will be provided later.

Publications

All reports have been removed. Some will be put back after their
fate is decided.

Miscellaneous

All other links have been removed. They will be put back in
phases.




A "date-last-modified" is a good idea here at the end of
a document (any document).
