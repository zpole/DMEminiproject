Fad "Poncho" Mad Hab's Home Page







Poncho's on the web





This page is blacked out to protest against the signing of the U.S. Telecom
Bill and its Communications Decency Amendment into law. Stand up for free
speech on the Net! Check out the
EFF
site for
details. To learn how you can participate, click on the ribbon.













Oh yes, you should've taken that left turn at Albuquerque!


No point kidding myself. With the
cute icon, you'd probably think somebody's working on this page. But no! I
can't be bothered to do that! Sometimes, I get sick of seeing the same lame
page over and over, so I rearrange it a little, rewrite this blurb, change the
nice pic, and voila! A fresh new page. Aaaaaah....

While you're holding your breath waiting for this work of art, why don't you
take a look at some of my friends' pages? Here's a quick list:



Captain Nemo
's
gateway to galactic goings-on!


fox
's
NetBSD propaganda.


jetset
's fat-free page.


chuckies
' tribute to minimalism.


Tyler
's
pleasure principle.


Simon
's ecstatic trance port.


Mappy
's repository of
samples
from his
excellent but still anonymous band.

More to come!...
