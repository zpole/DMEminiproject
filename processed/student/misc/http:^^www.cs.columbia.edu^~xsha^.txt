I am Xinshi Sha. I come from
China
.
I am one of Professor
Steve Feiner
's
PhD students working at the
Graphics and User Interface
Laboratory
,
Dept. of Computer Science
,
Columbia University
.
Since I came here, I have been working on augmented reality
(our programming language is
Modula 3
):
(1) build a
VRML
parser;
(2) use anim3D to display VRML files;
(3) numerous modifications and additions to anim3D to meet the needs of
VRML file displaying, to provide more functionality and flexibilty,
to improve anim3D performance, including 2D text, 2D window,
(indexed) polygon set, use of display lists with run-time caching of state
information to allow incremental display list modification, etc.
This work is part of our development of
Coterie
, a testbed for fast prototyping of distributed virtual
environment systems.

During summer 1996, I worked as a MTS at Multimedia Communication
Research Department,
Bell Labs
,
Lucent Technology
, Holmdel, NJ.

Before I came here, I spent one year at the
Computer Science Dept.
of the
University of New Hampshire
.
Besides, I got my M.S and B.S in Computer Science from
Fudan University
,
China
.
