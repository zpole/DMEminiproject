Albert's Homepage





Welcome to Yu Zhou's Homepage




It
seems this page is always under construction!!!



Hello, let me introduce myself.
Albert
is the nickname I would like to use, since the first name "Yu" (You)
is very confusing (not to mention also difficult to pronounce) in a group
environment. I am a graduate student (Computer Science Dept.) at
Rutgers
University
where I also had my undergraduate study (guess I am stuck
in New Brunswick campus forever!). By the way, I was born in Shanghai, China. Stay tuned for more web links to the points of interest about China.

Here
are some links I have collected so far ...
