E D U C A T I O N


I am a graduate
student at NMSU Computer Science Department. My major interests are in
Computer Communucations, Multimedia Programming, and Human-Computer Interaction.


I graduated from Yarmouk University
(1990 - 1993) with a B.S. Degree in Computer Science.




My Social Life



I met many people
from many nationalities at NMSU which made big changes in my life. I also
had a nice long vacation to learn more about people's communication and
behavior. I spent almost one year in the Albuquerque area,and got adopted
by a nice lady.

However,
I am missing my friends and family back in
Jordan

(Middle East)
and probably
I will make a fast visit soon.
