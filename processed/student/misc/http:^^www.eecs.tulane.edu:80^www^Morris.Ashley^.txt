Aloha from Yellowstone.
I received my
B.S.
(1985) and
M.S.
(1995) degrees from
USM
,
and I'm attending
Tulane
University's
PhD program in
computer science
in the murder capital of all of God's creation,
New Orleans
.
Here are some of my computer science related
publications
, and here are some
quotes
and
opinions
, even on
Operating Sytems
.
If you wish,
take a gander at my
resume
.
I've toiled in the computer industry, everywhere from
the friendly company swallowed by the death star
AT&T/McCaw
to the makers of the
fastest
chip in the world
with the worst marketing,
Digital
.

Before I shattered my
tibia in a
wreck (caused by a wrong way, hit-and-run driver), I rode a
lot. Here, I'm in front of the Golden Gate on my 1984
Honda Nighthawk CB750SCE.
This pic was taken on a road trip from Tijuana to Vancouver up PCH.
Thanks to Fieldsheer and
AGV
for saving
my skin and my skull, thanks to Howard for the
bike, and thanks to Steve and Ed for dragging me out of the road.  Don't dress
for the ride, dress for the crash.

Behold
the cover from my demo album.
I'm licensed with
BMI
,
and some of my music appeared in
Ashlyn Gere's
