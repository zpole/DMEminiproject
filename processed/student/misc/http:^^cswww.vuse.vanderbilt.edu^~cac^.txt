Home document for Cynthia A. Childers

Welcome to the home page of Cynthia A. Childers


I am a Ph.D. student
in the
Computer Science Department
at
Vanderbilt University
,
Nashville, Tennessee.
My advisor is
Dr. Larry Dowdy
, and I am a member of the Performance
Evaluation Group
(PEG)
which works in conjunction with
Oak Ridge National Lab
(ORNL)
on the early evaluation
of systems.
I received a B.S. degree in computer science
from the
University of Tennessee at Knoxville
in
1988.
I completed my M.S. degree in computer science
in 1994 here at Vanderbilt University.
From 1988 until 1994 I was employed at the IBM Software
Solutions Laboratory at Westlake in Roanoke, Texas.
I am currently working on my Ph.D. at IBM's
T. J. Watson Research Center
in Yorktown Heights, NY.
I expect to complete my Ph.D. in December 1996.
My research interests include performance modeling and prediction,
computer architecture,
parallel and distributed systems, and parallel I/O.
My dissertation topic is in the area of parallel I/O
workload characterization and the optimization of
RAID performance.
I am also working on performance supplement textbooks and their
solutions sets:
P.S. to Operating Systems
,
Solutions to P.S. to Operating Systems
(both available from Prentice
Hall), and
P. S. to Computer Architecture
(coming soon), jointly
sponsored by CMG and ACM/SIGMETRICS.
I have contributed to an
experimental log
of the PEG's work
on the Intel Paragon XP/S at ORNL.
Recent papers/publications include:

Striping policies in multiclass disk arrays
, Ph.D. Proposal, May 1995.

About myself, I am an avid reader, everything from Nobel prize
winners to romance novels.
I enjoy exercising: running, swimming, biking, basketball, and more.
I love traveling and have spent time in Holland, Ireland, France,
Italy, Lebanon, and the Netherland Antilles.
I like to cook (and eat); I hate to clean.
I have a cat and a husband.
Life is short.
Work hard.
Play hard.
Love a lot.
Get plenty of rest and eat your vegetables.
