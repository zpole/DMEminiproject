Neat stuff about Brad Fischer




Note: Some people may be offended by material on this page, or
on pages accessible from this one.





Master's Degree, Computer Science,

Georgia Institute
of Technology

Hey dudes!

I'm Brad Fischer, a Master's Degree recipient at
the
College of Computing
.
I finally finished my degree in December, 1995!
What's new here


December 16, 1995
I got access to a color scanner, so I added a
photograph page
.  My
résumé
is slightly updated,
reflecting my new
degree
(and I made general
updates to the whole site to reflect that).

Projects on the World Wide Web


I revised the Web site for the

Pauline Oliveros
Foundation
.
Vita brevis, ars longa.

During the summer of 1995 I worked on
CITATION
, a class project for one of
my courses.
In the summer of 1994, I worked on another class project: the design
of an
interface
for an information kiosk system for an art museum
.
I helped create the
Management Organizational Review Online
Network
system, which I use to tell my managers
what I'm
currently doing
as well as
what my recent
accomplishments are
.  The system is so clever, it even knows what
your
current job responsibilities
are! (I ought to mention that this service
is provided by
Encompass Technologies
)

Art and Music

I dabble in
photography
and
music
.  Some of it is worth sharing.
This is how I keep this Web site from being totally content-free; none
of this stuff should be available anywhere else.
Other stuff

If you're desperate for entertainment, here are some other things you can
read about:


My education

My background

My job

My (strange) sense of humor


If, on the other hand, you want to find out about someone interesting,
you can read about
Katherine Setar
(who couldn't get a Web page of her own).

You can
view my résumé
or get a copy in
PostScript
.
