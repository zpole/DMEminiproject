GAURAV  AGGARWAL





I am a graduate student at the
University of
California, Irvine
in the
Department of Information and Computer Science
. My area of specialization
is
Computer Systems
Design
with emphasis on Design Automation. I plan to do research with my
advisor
Prof. Daniel Gajski
and
Prof. Nikhil Dutt
for completing
my doctoral degree.
UC, Irvine is one of the nine campuses of the
University of California
. Probably the

most beautiful amongst all
(I haven't seen any other), it is situated in
Southern California, USA, about 80 kms south of Los Angeles. The mascot of
UCI is the Anteater, shown on the right.
