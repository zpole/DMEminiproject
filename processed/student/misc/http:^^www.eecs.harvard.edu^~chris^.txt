Christopher Small


PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard. Concentrating on the
intersection of operating systems, database systems, and programming
languages. Working on extensibility technology and support for the VINO
operating system, as well as hacking together process and thread support for
VINO. Advisor is Dr. Margo Seltzer. Graduation expected mid-1997. An
academic job is my first choice at the moment, but I'm flexible. Other
random small research projects on the side.

Spent ten years in industry before starting the PhD program. Mostly at
startups, working on the first commercial object database at what is
now called
Ontos
, on a blue-sky
distributed object-oriented persistent heterogeneous development
platform (and started the On Location project) at an earlier
incarnation of
ON Technology
, and on
BeyondMail
at Beyond
Inc. (since purchased by Banyan).  I also worked at some larger
places, like
Bell Labs
on
compiler tools,
Microsoft
on
"Object OS/2" (pieces of which are now called OLE and Cairo), and
Siemens-Nixdorf, on a multimedia email system that got spun out and
became
InterMail
.
