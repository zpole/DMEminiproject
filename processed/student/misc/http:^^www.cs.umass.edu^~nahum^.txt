I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the
Department
of Computer Science
at the
University of
Massachusetts
.  My advisors are
Jim
Kurose
and
Don
Towsley
.
I also work closely with
David
Yates
.
I'm a member of the
Computer
Networks Research Group
.
I received my B.A. in computer science from
The University of Wisconsin

in 1988 and my M.S.  degree in computer science from UMass
in 1991.
When they let me, I try to collaborate with the
Network Systems Research Group

at the
University of Arizona CS Department
.
I'm a member of the ACM, IEEE, and USENIX.
