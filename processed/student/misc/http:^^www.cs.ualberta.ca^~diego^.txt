I'm a PhD candidate at the department of
Computing Science
at the
University of
Alberta
. I came from
CÃ³rdoba
(Argentina) in September of 1993 to start my PhD program.
My research topic is transparent shared memory in multiprocessor
environments. Both distributed and tightly-coupled MIMD machines are
considered. The emphasis is placed on compiler technology and
meta-programming issues to transparently support shared memory in
procedural pointer-based programming languages.
As part of my research program, I am involved in the
Enterprise
project which is part
of the
Parallel
Programming Systems Laboratory.
My supervisors are:
Jonathan Schaeffer
and
Ron Unrau

I am also working for
CNS
(Computing and Network Services) in the Research Computing Support Group.
My duties include system administration, support and consulting for the
supercomputing users in campus. Our systems include an IBM
SP2
parallel computer, a
workstation
farm
for numeric intensive problems and several RS/6000 boxes used in
distributed applications.
