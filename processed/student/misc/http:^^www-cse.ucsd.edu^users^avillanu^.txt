Non compos mentis. . .

I'm a Master of  Science student in the
Department of Computer Science and Engineering
at
UCSD
,
specializing in Multimedia Systems and Digital Signal Processing.
I was last a software engineer at
Microcosm
, a pioneering
company in low-cost space mission engineering.  I am, however, first and foremost,
a starving student.
My undergraduate degree is in Applied Mathematics and Computation from
UCLA
.
Anyway, here's my
resume
for anyone interested.
