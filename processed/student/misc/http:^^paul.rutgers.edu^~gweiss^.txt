About Me:

I am pursuing a Computer Science PhD (in Artificial Intelligence).  I started
the program in September 1993, entering with a Master's in Computer Science
(from Stanford in 1986).  I have worked at AT&T Bell Labs since 1986, and
continue to work there and go to school part-time.

I work in AT&T's Network Services Division, on an expert system to maintain
Network Switching elements.
