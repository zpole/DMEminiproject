Home Page: Wade Holst


This is the index for my (kinda large) home page, which is broken up into
more managable sub-documents.  Have a browse, and feel free to
send
me suggestions for improvements.
This collection of documents has become my repository for personal
thoughts.  In most cases I can't see the stuff I have written down being of
much interest to anyone but myself, but it's here if you are interested.
I provide it to the world because, hey, all it took to allow others to read
it was some permission modifications :-)
Finally, the typical disclaimer: These documents are completely my creation, so
any material herein that you find objectionable should be addressed to me.
Don't go blaming the university or the comp. sci. department for
my
thoughts.  For the most part, I have attempted to keep the world readable
documents "acceptable" to everyone.
