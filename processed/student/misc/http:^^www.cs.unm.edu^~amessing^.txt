Adam's Homepage
Hi, I'm a graduate student here in the Department of Computer Science
at the University of New Mexico.  I'm working for
Dave Ackley
as an R.A.  I could tell you what I
was working on, but then I would have to kill you.  Haven't really had
time to work on a homepage as much as I would have liked.  You can
however get my
resume (CV)
.  You might prefer the
PostScript version
if you plan on printing it.



Academic Interests
Generally I am interested in computers and how they can make my life
better.  That interest takes a lot of different forms.  I like HCI,
new approaches to computation and techniques to describe them.  I am
also interesting in using computer modelling as a tool to better
understand the natural world, especially if this understanding can in
turn be leveraged to build better computer systems.  In this vein I
worked at
The Santa Fe Institute
last year where I worked on evolving Cellular Automata (you can look
at my
homepage
there
to see what I was up to.)


Politics


I am really quite concerned with the recent
censorship
activities, such as the Telecommunications Reform Bill, on the
'net
and
writ
large
.  I also try to keep track of a few other issues, most
importantly to me are
privacy
and
other
civil
liberties
, especially
electronic
freedom
.  In addition I believe that the Drug War and the
hiring
practices
which accompany is a threat to civil rights.
I am a member of the
Electronic Frontier
Foundation
and the
American Civil
Liberties Union
as well as the
Association for Computing Machinery
.  I
also support the
Internet Privacy
Coalition
, the
League for Programming
Freedom
, the
Free
Software Foundation/GNU
, and the
cypherpunk
ideal.

Recreation
I enjoy most outdoor activities, especially [rock, ice, mountain]
climbing
and
taking pictures thereof
.  I have always
lived quite near the wilderness and plan on moving back if this whole
global village, telecommuting thing comes true.  Heck, these days even
the
American Alpine
Club
and the
Access Fund
are online.  I
just joined both this year.
I have a fondness for
nice
beer
.  In particular I find Bridgeport Special (only availiable at
their brewpub that I know of) and Pintail ESB, Full Sail Pilsner,
Widmer Hefeweizen and Sierra Nevada Porter to be very pleasing.  While
I think that their quality control has slipped in recent years I also
enjoy an occasional Ruby from the McMenamins (I would recommend the
smaller places that still brew their own beer on site.); how I miss
the Pacific Northwest.  Fundamentaly I guess I am just another typical
West-coast, high-quality-of-life, slacker.

Travel
I am planning to take a
trip
to
South-East Asia
,
New
Zealand
, and
Australia
within the next year.  I spent some of my formative
years in New Zealand, so I am really looking forward to visting.  Any
advice/reccomendations appreciated.
Web Resources
Despite my rather
feeble web page, I really do think that the WWW is a useful tool.  If
I had more time, I might make more use of these tools and resources.

HTML converters

OneWorld/SingNet WWW and HTML Developer's JumpStation - ver 2.0 (21 Oct 1994)

Composing Good HTML

A nice essay by my friend
J. Eric Tilton
about
writing HTML.
html-helper-mode

An emacs mode written by my partner in crime at SFI,
Nelson Minar
which makes
writing HTML a bit less painful.

Uh, if you are interested you can get my
current
bookmarks
.  I know that's kind of lame, just throwing those all
out there without comments and all, sorry 'bout that.  You can also
take a peek at my
Gnus Adaptive Scoring Files
if
you like.  I think that these are examples of nice simple ways that
people can share knowledge.
