Sorry!  My home page needs a complete overhaul.  Maybe when I get the time..
I am now a grad student at the
University of California at San Diego

(UCSD)
, working for my Master's degree in
Computer Science
.
It is nice and sunny here in
San
Diego
.
I recently graduated from the
University of California at
Berkeley
with a B.S. in
Electrical
Engineering & Computer Science
with an emphasis in
Computer Science
(phew!).  My undergrad years were fun, but they were a ton of work and
consisted of many, many
sleepless
nights.

Go Bears!

I'm still working on this page, and so there isn't much here yet.  But for now, here are some of my WWW
bookmarks
.  There's also a meow hidden in this page.
Take a look at my personal virtual
newspaper
.
Here are my
computer science related links
.
Here are some
people
that I know.
Things are still a bit messy here.
