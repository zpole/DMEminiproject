Biographical Sketch
I received the Diploma in Informatics from the
Latin American School of Informatics (ESLAI)
in
Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1992.  I also received the degree of Computer
System Analyst and the Diploma in Computer Science from the
University of Buenos Aires
in 1992 and
1993, respectively.  In 1993, I began my graduate studies at the
Dept. of Computer Science and
Engineering
, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), receiving
my Master's degree a year later.
At the present time, I am working towards my Ph.D. in Computer Science
with Prof.
Flaviu
Cristian
at UCSD.  My research focuses on fault-tolerance in
distributed systems.  I have also worked on compilers and run-time support
for parallel programming.
