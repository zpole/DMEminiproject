My latest pictures








In March Ohio State insisted that I take a "spring break" from engineering. However, the  gods decided that my break shouldn't resemble Spring, and
I decided to do some engineering of my own.
This is my officemate, Benjamin, who is in charge of office security.
It's no wonder Ben and I have gone between three jobs over the last four
years.
