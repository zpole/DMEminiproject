Mountains teach us so much, without saying a word.




Hello. I am
Bogdan
UNGUREANU
's Home Page.



This document is under construction and open to comment!
Suggestions are strongly invited, so if you think of anything, please
email it to  bogdan@cs.nwu.edu





I am a so called
ILS graduate student
, (
or a 2nd year CS-PhD if you prefer
)  in
Computer Science
at
The Institute for the Learning Sciences
,
Northwestern University
.
For now, you can only see
a few photos I took during the COOL robotics class
we had in the 1996 spring quarter (special thanks to Pete BEIM for
scanning & making them available on the Web),
but I hope to put some more images on the Web,
let's say, in the near future, since the term sounds relative enough.

I come from
Cluj-Napoca,

Romania
.
If you have time to check out
more information about my homecountry
, the Web has it all.
If you think that sometimes an image can say more than a thousand
words, you may want to take a look at
some images from Romania.


As much as about my ..


Education

I graduated in 1990, from
The Technical University of Cluj-Napoca
, where I pursued 5 years of full-time study towards an engineer diploma.

Since October 1991 I have worked as assistant professor at the same
university, in the
CS department
.
I am a member of the
AI research group
there.


In 1994 I visited the US for the first time, as an intern in the
"Summer 1994 Internship Program For the Advancement of Software
Engineering Technology".



Wheather information
for almost any place. Still, I guess I feel better if I know
what's coming my way.
