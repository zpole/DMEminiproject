Home Page for Rob Conticello




Rob Conticello
Fourth year Computer Science graduate student.  My advisor is
Panos Chrysanthis
.
A new more conservative and corporate home page for a new more conservative
me.  There are no bells, whistles, or things that go "bump" in the 'net
on this page, and frankly the only Java that I will be seeing for the next few months
is the kind that I internally consume each afternoon.  So stop in and have a
cup, realizing that while I may no longer love you, you're still welcome
nonetheless.
