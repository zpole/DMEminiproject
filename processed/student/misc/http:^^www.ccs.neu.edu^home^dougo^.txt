Doug's Home Page




Welcome.
Hi!  My name's Doug.  This is my page.
I am a grad student at
Northeastern University
.

I hope to get a PhD in
Computer Science
before the next
millenium.  I'm currently planning to study the technological
aspects of
muds
.

I'm currently taking two classes:


Operating Systems
(COM 3360) with
Prof. John Casey


Computer Architecture
(COM 3200) with
Prof. Gene Cooperman

Textbook:
Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, Second Edition
by
David A. Patterson
and
John L. Hennessy
.
I'm also working as a research assistant for
Prof. Karl Lieberherr
;
my current project is
Demeter/Java
.  We just submitted a
research demonstration proposal
for
ICSE 97
.
If you're in the Boston area, you might want to come to one of
several seminars that are held at Northeastern (in room 107 of
Cullinane Hall
):


Programming Language Semantics
, Wednesdays 9:30am-11:30am

Cryptography
, Thursdays 10:00am-11:45am

Demeter
, Fridays 10:00am-12noon

Distributed Systems
, Fridays 1:00pm-2:30pm

I used to work at
Pure Software
.  I
still work
for
them, from my apartment in
Boston, Massachusetts
,
in my
copious free time
.
I'm a little wary of the growing
cult of
Netscape
.  But hey, I use it too, and
Jamie
Zawinski
is a cool guy.  After all, he also wrote
XEmacs
.  Maybe if had written
GNUscape
too I would have better luck getting it to work...
I conducted a poll of Chugchanga-L members for
their
favorite records of 1995
.
I've made some
mix tapes
of music I like.
I drive a 1993
Honda Civic
.
There are a bunch more links in my
bookmarks
file
.



(This is a cool logo that I did for my xface for the
CSUA
.
Try standing on your head.)
