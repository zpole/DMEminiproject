Some Information About Myself:
I come from Ankara, the capital of
Turkey
.
In 1991, I earned a BS degree in computer science and engineering from the
Department of CSE
at
Hacettepe University, Ankara.
Then, I came to the states in 1992, by means of a scholarship from Turkish
government. In 1994, I earned a MS degree in computer science from the
CCS
at
Northeastern University, Boston.
I concentrated on the area of artificial intelligence during my MS
studies. I am recently a PhD candidate in the same college. My current
research interests fall under the area of programming languages, especially
compilers and semantics of programming languages.
