Hello. As you may know, I am a PhD student in
Computer Science
at
Harvard University
(one of the
Ivy League
). So far, it has been a lot of fun. Before this, I worked at
Digital
on distributed management and internet related products. For a little while I was part of the 'real world' which was after being a student in
Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science
at
MIT.
I spent many years at the Institute; getting my Masters in '95. Once i finish all this schooling, I would like to go to the
beaches
of
California
for a long while, learn how to surf, become a beach bum and work on a tan. You may call me a dreamer but i think i have a goal in life.
My academic and research interests include computer
networking
,
parallel computer architectures
,
distributed computing
,
operating systems
and the
internet
. I guess i cover the computer systems area but touching
software
and communication along the ways. I look at myself as a tall thin engineer because i attempt to learn as much as possible about as many topics as i can humanly do without killing myself. But I am very interested in
management
and
business
. In the future, i see myself combining both roles of an engineer and a manager. But, we shall see about that.
Outside of school, i am engaged in various activities. I participate in many graduate teams at
Dudley House
including soccer, ultimate and volleyball. I am also a non-resident tutor at
Leverett House
which is one of the undergraduate dorms. I am an active participant at
St. Mark's
. When i have a chance, i ride my bike along the
Charles River
in
Boston
, read a
newspaper
or even watch some
television
.
I love to
travel
. I have been to the west coast, midwest and all over the
east coast. By far, my favorite place is
San Francisco
. The weather is just unbelievable. I hope to be able to travel to many more parts of the US and actually start on
Europe
.
So where did I grow up? I am from a town in the suburbs of
New York City
called New Rochelle. It was named for the French Hugenot immigrants who came from La Rochelle.
Other than that, I enjoy
soccer
,
art
,
music
,
tennis
and
reading
.
