Click


here  for an introduction.


Thank you for showing interest in my
home page. I am a Ph.D. student
in the
Computer Science Department
at
Vanderbilt University
.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, primarily in the areas
of model-based and constraint-based reasoning. In the past,
I have investigated

model-based reasoning

techniques and
their application to

diagnosis

. I developed an interest in the application
of constraint-based reasoning to scheduling and design while
working one summer with Dr. Markus Fromherz at Xerox PARC.
Presently, I am investigating model-based approaches to
hardware and software design of "smart" systems.  My academic advisor
at school is
Dr. Gautam Biswas
.

I have an M.S. degree in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University,
and a B.E. degree in Computer Engineering from
Victoria Jubilee Technical
Institute
, Bombay, India.
