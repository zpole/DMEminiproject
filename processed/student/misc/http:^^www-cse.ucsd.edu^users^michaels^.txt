Welcome to my home page!

I'm a computer science grad student here at UCSD, working on my master's
degree.  I come originally from
Edmonton
, Alberta, Canada, but I've been here in California for a good while now, as I did my undergrad at
Harvey Mudd College
in Claremont, California.
Research
I have been working at the
San Diego
Supercomputer Center
since March of 1995.  Initially I was working on
SDSC's VRML browser,
WebView
, for which I implemented the network support. Over the last several
months I implemented SDSC's VRML behavior system,
VRBS
,
which was demonstrated at
The VRML Behavior
Workshop
in October, and at
Supercomputing 95
and
VRML 95
in December. This
year I am working on my master's thesis, VizWiz, a java applet for
interactive scientific visualization on the web.

You can find out more about these projects below.
