Jason's homepage


You can grab the latest version of my
.emacs (v0.95)
(emacs
configuration) if you'd like.  It's kinda big though (492+K).  So if you
want to just poke around the
individual directories
,
feel free.  Note, I don't always make a new tar file everytime I edit my
.emacs, so you may want to check the version number in my
.emacs
itself, and
bug me
to make a new tar file.
