Kazi Atif-Uz Zaman

I am a PhD student at the
Computer Science Department
of
Columbia University
.
My principle research interests are algorithms for effective information retrieval on the Internet and
Digital Libraries
.
I completed my undergraduate education in Computer Science at the
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur
,India.
Disappointed by the lack of normal web paraphernalia ? Check out some
java applets
I've written.  It's not my fault if
string matching algorithms dont drive you wild with excitement.
