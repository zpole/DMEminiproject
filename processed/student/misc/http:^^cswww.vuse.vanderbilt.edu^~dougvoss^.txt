Welcome!  For those of you who don't know me....  I am a
Ph.D. candidate in the
Department of Computer Science
at
Vanderbilt University
.
My research focuses upon uncertainty in temporal databases.  My
dissertation, a work in progress, is titled:
Indeterminacy in
Temporal Databases
.  For more information about my work, you
might want to read over a
technical report
(postscript) I wrote with my advisor
Dr. Patrick
C. Fischer
; it presents some of the results which will appear in
my dissertation.  If you prefer, an ASCII version of the
abstract
is also available.  If you check back in late February
you should find a pointer to the dissertation itself!
