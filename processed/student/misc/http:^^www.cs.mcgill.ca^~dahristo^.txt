My study and research
I am a MSc student in Computer Science. It is already
my second year and a lot of things are behind me. Reading, programming,
presentations, few exams, TA hours. Graduate studies are taking a lot
of time and energy but there is a lot of excitment and challenge. Follow
this link
to see
more details about my research , what I have done and
what I am doing now (if interested at all).
Interested in computer communication? Is INTERNET going to change our
society and make it a global village? I am interested so much that
I decided to devote my professional life to it. Make it faster, more
efficent, more managable, make it open. Interconnect it, control it
(and collect the payment of course). I am doing my thesis in the area
of ATM and protocol testing. If this looks odd have a
glance here. This
work is ongoing
and it will last (I hope) untill early 1997 when I
plan to graduate. It looks endless but of course it is not.
You need
my  resume, pick it up from her.
I am trying to keep it updated as
much as possible, things are happening really fast.
