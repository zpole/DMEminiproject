Current Research
I am currently working on a protype application that autmatically
assembles video presentations based on a users query.  VIDQUERY utilizes
a database of video segments and a set of constraints to ensure that
the resulting presentation is semantically coherant.  The first phase of
the project allows the user to specify a query by viewing and selecting
segments that are to be included in the resulting presentation, along with
the desired length of the presentation.  The second phase of the project
will automatically select the initial segments to include based on a
database query.
