Research Interests
My work is in the
field of Natural Language Processing.
More specifically, I am constructing a dialog parser to analyze
dialog structure as well as phrase structure.  This dialog parser will also
be able to handle disfluencies such as hesistations and repairs which are
common in mixed-initiative dialogs.
I do much of my work with the
TRAINS group
.
I have also been helping with a
dialog annotation
project
since it is related to my work on dialog parsing.

Bachelor's Work:
I received my bachelors degree from RPI where I worked with Michael Skolnick.
For more  information:
I have a large collection of
NLP pointers
as well as
random personal information and pointers
