MASTER PROJECT


Equa: a Visual Equation Editor/Formatter
Equa is an editor for the X System.  It includes an interface, and a
window to display the abstract tree of the equation.   For the
quadratic equation, here it is for those who where absent that day in
algebra class d:-)


which produces the following abstract tree

An abstract tree is used because it make the structure of the equation
explicit.  Equa allows you to edit the equation directly on the
screen, and allows tree manipulations (abstract calculi) across the
branches of the subtrees.

A Report and User's Manual is here:

Acknowlegements
Equa was designed, implemented and presented in partial fulfilment of
the requirements for the degree of Master Of Science in Computer
Science, at New Mexico State University.  I want to thank Dr. Joe
Pfeiffer, for introducing me to this project, all his advice and his
support.  Financial support was provided through a grant [HRD-9353271] from the
National Science Fundation, and Dr. Hector J. Hernandez.
