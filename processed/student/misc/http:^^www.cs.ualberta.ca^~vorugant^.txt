Research Areas





Database Systems




Research Interests

I am interested in the following research areas:

Database Support For Mobile Systems
Database Support For Multimedia Systems
OO Database Benchmarking (OO7,OO1,HyperModel)
Repository technology (control and data integration strategies)
Applied Systems Performance Evaluation (simulations)
Heterogeneous distributed database integration using CORBA/OLE technologies (used ORBIX)
Software Engineering (Process design and tool integration strategies)
Parallel Processing (PVM, PAMS,Enterprise, Petri-Net Modeling)
Web technologies (Distribution Architecture using JAVA)

PhD Details


I am currently designing and implementing the data distribution architecture for an
object-oriented database. The interesting problems have been
identified (passed candidacy exam) and I am now formulating solutions to these problems.
I am working on low-level DBMS system issues.
Due to the
confidential nature of this information, I cannot divulge it on the net.
Basically, I am simulating some new algorithms in order to evaluate their characteristics, and
am also implementing them as part of distributed TIGUKAT OODBMS. I love
building systems.
