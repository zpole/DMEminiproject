Research
Projects:
I am interested in a great many things including but not limited to
software architecture, experimental programming, the software
marketplace, programming in the small, commerical software package
development, evolutionary programming, programming by demonstration,
taking the object-oriented programming paradigm far beyond any
reasonable expectation, user programming, software process in the
small, user interfaces in general and their implementation.
