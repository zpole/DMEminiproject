I also have a
personal
web page.


I'm an active member of the
Computer Systems Laboratory
,
working on a novel operating system abstraction.

I believe it is possible to design an efficient kernel that also
gives extreme design flexibility to OS designers and user-level
programmers.  Operating systems are large complex systems, and
should be able to leverage on technologies and techniques
currently available for large complex user-level programs.
However, this must be done without sacrificing performance.

Some other projects working on similar themes are:
Flux
,
Exokernel
,
L3 and L4
,
Cache Kernel
, and
SPIN
.
A good place to find information about current operating system
projects is
here
.

With this group, I'm also interested in developing a research
agenda dealing with the issues of resource identification and
authentification in a mobile wireless environment.

You can see me say the same thing in my
1995 Research Summary
.


I have strong interests in human factors and software
engineering, and believe that computer scientists should spend
more time thinking about
people
than they do.

In my spare time (ha ha ha), I'm interested in linguistics.
Over the years, I've shifted from "computational natural
language processing" to "human language comprehension by
humans".  Second language learning currently attracts me here.


To help remember when various interesting talks are on campus,
I've begun to organize the seminar announcements for a few
groups.  For example, you can find the current
UCSD AI Research Group
listings.  Other groups can be found
here
.
If you have any suggestions, comments or want your favorite
research group's seminar schedule available, send some
email
.


I'm hoping to get around to entering bibliography information on
the 300+ papers currently sitting in my bedroom.  Of course, I'd
rather not do this, so if you know of good locations for me to
obtain this information already in computer format, I'll take
you to lunch or something.
