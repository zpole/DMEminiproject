Research Area:
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Information and Computer Science.
My dissertation is in the area of specification-based software
testing.  In particular, my focus is on using formal specifications to
derive test cases that can be used to test the specified program.  I
have developed a rule-based approach for deriving test cases from
axiomatic languages (languages based on predicate logic; Z and ANNA
are examples of axiomatic specification languages) and applied it to a
formal specification language called the
Assertion
Definition Language (ADL)
.
