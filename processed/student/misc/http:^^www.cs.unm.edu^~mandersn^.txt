Mark's Homepage
Original, isn't it?  I'm just learning HTML, because I have always wanted my
own homepage, but have never had the time to learn HTML (I didn't realize it
was so easy!), much less put everything together into one page.



Here are links to some of my other pages:

is a page for those times that you can't lock your terminal.

is a list of my friends homepages.
