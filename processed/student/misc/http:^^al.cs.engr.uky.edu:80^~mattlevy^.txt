personal interests, and also contains some links to pages I think are
pretty cool.

Research interests
Currently, I'm working in
structural complexity
with
Judy Goldsmith
.
We're currently researching the complexity of various kinds of
Markov Decision Processes.
I'm also looking at a kind of resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.

Current papers

Lance Fortnow
,
Judy Goldsmith
,
Steve Mahaney
, and
Matthew A. Levy
.
L-printable sets (Journal version)
. Extended abstract in the Proceedings
of the 1996 IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity.  To appear in the
SIAM Journal of Computing.

Judy Goldsmith
,
Matthew A. Levy
, and
Martin Mundhenk
.
Limited Nondeterminism
.  Survey article appeared in June, 1996
SIGACT news.  This is an extended version, with appendices on finite automata
and the classes LogNP and LogSNP.

Personal Details

My wife is
Amy Levy

,
the tragically hip RA.
Here
is a
picture of us.
I have two children, John and Alex.  They're 9 and 7, respectively.  I
hope to have a page for them soon, but you can see
a picture
if you like.  Aren't they cute?
Unfortunately, our last two fish died, and I never did get pictures of
any of them.  So, in addition to our kids, our family contains our
attack guinea pig, Storm, our cat Sebastian, and our dog, Gypsy.
We just moved last month, so Sebastian is still adjusting.  Gypsy, however,
loves having a backyard, and has now figured out how to open the
gate!  It is wonderful having a smart dog most of the time, but sometimes
I think maybe she's too clever for our own good...









Here are two pictures of Gypsy.



Interests
My major activity, outside of family life and school, is music.  I've
been playing guitar for around 16 years, mostly blues.

Here, you can see one of my heroes,
Buddy Guy.
Recently, I've started studying Tai Chi.  I'm still looking for a good
Tai Chi link.
I also love old movies and good standup comedy.
