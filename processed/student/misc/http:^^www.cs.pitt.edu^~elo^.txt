Hey,
who
is this Leo Selavo anyway...



Who is Leo Selavo anyway ?

Presently I am a graduate student at the
Department
of Computer Science
at the
University
of Pittsburgh
.

I am a latvian. Born in
Latvia
(you
know, one of those there Baltic Republics), grown up there, now gone to
the United States to study.

I got my Masters Degre in Computer Science at the
University
of Latvia
in 1994.

I used to work at the
University of Latvia
as a lecturer. I was instructor for such classes as "
Human-Computer
Interaction
", "
Personal Computer Organization
"
and "
Seminar on Issues on Data Visualisation
".

Also I used to work at
RITI, the Riga
Information Technology Institute
. RITI is (was?) a subsidiary of the
SIS (SWH Informative Systems)
company
in Latvia. My work at RITI was linked to meta-model based CASE software
tool development.


Brief insight in my interests:



Computer architecture, human-computer interaction

Skiing (downhill and Xcountry), tennis (court and table)

Hiking, checking out wild nature, like America's National Parks (I've
been in about twenty of them).

Photographing,
video
filming

Music: Pop/Rock, Jazz. Some of my favourite artists and groups are:
Elton John, Eric Clapton, Joe Cooker, Rod Stewart, Annie Lenox, Pink Floyd,
Ella Fitgerald, Louis Armstrong...

Books, Science fiction. My favourite authors are:


Isaac Asimov - you can never tell what will happen next. Everything
is pretty reasoned. Exellent books and storries beside science fiction
as well.

Frank Herbert - Dune chronicles - mix of action, mystery and philosophy.
Although not so easy to read, still fascinating.

Douglas Adams - lot's of fun, original ideas.

Andrew Norton - great action storry builder.

This page is under construction (if you haven't noticed yet). Still
it's readable/viewable. Perhaps, will be under construction permanently.
Isn't it nice? Every time you may expect something new here...
