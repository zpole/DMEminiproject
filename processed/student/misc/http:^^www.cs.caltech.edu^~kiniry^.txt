Joseph Roland Kiniry
(Anagram: Opinions Hardly Jerk)

I am a Graduate student in Computer Science at the California
Institute of Technology.  Having just moved to Pasadena, I'm still
becoming re-accustomed to sunny weather. I recently worked in the
midwest as a consultant to the Multimedia/Internet Division at Sprint.
There I was a project lead and co-architect of the division's
infrastructure.  I finally found the time to get some
pictures
online.  See some betrothal
pictures and two houses; one I live in and one we ate!

Who is
Joe Kiniry
and what does he do?
My current project:
Infospheres
.  What
projects
have I been involved in?
What do I find
interesting
?
Who are some of my
friends
on the net?

Creative
efforts by myself
and others.
What are some of my
favorite
sites
on the net?
What was that fool doing,
traveling
around the nation like that?!
