Hope you weren't expecting too much.  I'm brand new to this
whole internet thang, so I expect my home page will get more
interesting as time goes on.



Info


I am currenty a PhD student at the
Department
of Computer Science
at the University of California,
San Diego
.  My
advisor (yes, I do have one) is
Keith Marzullo
, with whom I am doing work on Distributed Systems.
I'd like to be more specific, but I'm not there yet.
It looks like it will be involved in the
Serrano
project.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Meanwhile, these are the
conferences
and
classes
that mean
something to me these days.
Here are my vital statistics:

More info
Before I made the big leap to
graduate school
, I was a
beer drinker
in
New York City
, which
is a habit I learned while at
college
.
Actually, if you went to
Princeton
as well, you might be interested in
the Princeton Alumni Council
.
I got
married
.
Twice
.

Here's a connection to my
mother-in-law
(she's the first picture).
I still work for
SEER Technologies
, on the
Freeway
team.  Need proof that
we're actually making useful stuff?  Check out this
press release
.
I am now one of the administrators of
Chez Bob
.
Of course, there's more to life than serving others.  Around here, we
try to entertain ourselves:
concerts
,
CDs
,
sports
,
T.

V.
,
mov
ies
,
biking
,
learning about stuff
,
even local
touristy
traps!  And of course, reading
Dilbert
.
