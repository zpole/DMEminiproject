Harald Feiel








Welcome to my personal Web Page



Disclaimer

Hello, my name is Harald Feiel, and at the moment, you are visiting my
personal homepage. There is no charge for reading all the pages (but that is
actually a good idea, I'll think about payment methods). By the way, the
picture on top of the page does not have any similarities with me (at least
some people think so). For more information ask my girlfriend:
Alexandra
!
Within the next few weeks I will spend most of my time working on my
thesis
.
It is about 'Data Compression of Color Images Using Vector Quantization'.
My most recently compressed pictures will be published on this page. I might
also write an explanation of it.  I intend on keeping this page up to date,  so feel free to stop back again.
Another very time consuming endeavor is my correspondance via email with my friend
Claus
in Austria, who is also responsible for updating the European link of the
WWWW-page
. On this page we publish all our bets about various sporting events. Of course
we also have an outdated
American link
of this page (yes, you guessed it right, it is my responsibility).
I plan on offering a page with a plethora of links to all kinds of sports web pages, but that page will not be available until March!
Last but not least, I want to mention the best non-european I know, who incidentally is also my personal friend and car mechanic. He is
Tom,
who is without a head at the moment if his computer is switched off


. You don't believe it?

CHECK IT OUT!


Friends
But
Tom
and
Claus
are not my only
friends! Excuse me, but what did YOU think? I also have a friend in Germany,
Ralf
, and a friend from
China:
Tian
.
