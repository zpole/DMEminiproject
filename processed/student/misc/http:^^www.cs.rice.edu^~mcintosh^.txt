Biography

In 1986 I graduated with an Sc.B. in Computer Science from Brown
University. From 1986 to 1990, I worked as a software engineer at
Teradyne, Inc., located in Boston, Mass.  I came to Rice in 1990. My
research interests include parallelizing compilers, symbolic analysis,
interprocedural analysis, and compiler management of memory
hierarchies. I am currently pursuing my thesis on compiler-directed
software prefetching, in collaboration with both the D group and the
Massively Scalar Compiler group.
