Theory Group

The theory group is a group of students in the department of computer
science and mathematics at Rutgers who meet on a semi-regular basis.
We are mostly interested in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer
science. Most of our talks are very informal given by one of the students.
If you want
to join in please send me email and I will put you on the mailing list.
We plan to have some invited speakers. Since there are so many talks in
or around Rutgers we make our meeting unique by keeping them mostly
informal. Sometimes after our talks we go and have dinner together.
Another peculiar thing about the theory group meetings is that no
professors are expected to attend our meetings.
Next Meeting

Friday 11th Oct 4:00 pm. I will be talking about "Probabilistic method:a lower bound on crossing number of a graph and its applications in combinatorial geometry."
Invited Speakers
I am happy to inform everyone that Prof. Noga Alon has accepted our
invitation to give an informal talk. The talk is scheduled
on Nov 5 at 5:00 pm. After the talk we will go for dinner with Prof. Alon.
