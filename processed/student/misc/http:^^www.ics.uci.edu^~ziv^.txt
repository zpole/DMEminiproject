Information and Course Notes for Students
The next meeting of Fall OOAD will be at the UNEX Lab at UC Irvine.

Click here for a map of the UCI Campus.

The building number for the UNEX Lab is 232,
shown on this detailed map.

For Fall OOAD course notes, look
Here.

The first notes available are for Week 3,
Classes
and Objects
.
Course Information
I teach two courses for
UCI Extension
,
one on object-oriented analysis and design,
the other on Windows NT/95 Programming using Visual C++ and MFC.
The textbook for my Object-Oriented Analysis and Design course is

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications
by
Grady Booch
,
published by
Addison Wesley
.
Research Projects
I develop a hypertext browser, called
IVAN
,
that affords better traceability of software systems by explicit
modeling of software uncertainties.
This work is done as part of the
Arcadia
research project at
UC Irvine
.
Research Papers
I recently completed a paper for
ICSE 97
on explicit modeling of software uncertainties.
The paper in its original, 10-point font, two column style
as required by ICSE, is entitled

"The Uncertainty Principle in Software Engineering."

To get the latest version of the paper, click
Here
.
Links to earlier versions of this paper can also be found in the
collection of papers on

Workflow and Process
Automation
.
Professional Interests
I know a few things about software engineering, software
process modeling, and object-oriented analysis and design.
I am also interested in Bayesian networks and uncertainty
modeling.
Object-Oriented Techniques
I am familiar with leading methods for OO analysis and design,
including the latest work on the Unified
Modeling Language (UML) and the OPEN/MOSES effort.
I am in fact a member of the
OPEN Consortium
.
For information on UML, see Rational's
Object Technology
web page.
A good source of information on OO CASE Tools on the Web
can be found
Here
.
In addition,
a collection of more than 2000 links about object-orientation
is available at

Cetus, Heidelberg, Germany
,
with mirror U.S. sites in
Chicago, Illinois

and
Provo, Utah
.
Bayesian Networks
I am interested in Bayesian networks.  There are a few quality pages
on this topic, including:

AFIT AI Laboratory


Lonnie Chrisman's Roadmap to Bayesian Research

Also, you can find a Bayesian Network Editor, implemented in Java, in the

Bayesian Editor page

Other Interests
Besides my profesional interests, I like to hike, jog, swim, and
rollerblade.  My favorite place to play roller-hockey is the
Irvine Hockey Club
.
My favorite sport, however, is soccer.
A good place to look for the latest soccer information is the
ESPN Sports Zone Soccer
web page.
For additional sports links, check with my friend
Neno
.
To learn more about me, take a look at my
Resume
.
Getting started with HTML
UCI's Office of Academic Computing has put together
some pointers on
how to learn HTML
.
