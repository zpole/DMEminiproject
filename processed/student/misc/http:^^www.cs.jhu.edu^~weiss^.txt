Academic Stuff
I am currently a PhD Student in
Computer Science
at
the Johns Hopkins University
in
Baltimore, MD
.
I am blessed with not one, not two, but three advisers,
Simon Kasif
,
Eric Brill
,
and
David Yarowsky
.
While my general interest is in
Artificial Intelligence
, the focus of my research is
on adaptive methods for Information Retrieval.
I've compiled a
Survey of Information Retrieval
which
lists many different papers, projects, and web sites devoted to various
aspects of IR. If you're just learning about the field, be sure to check
out my
glossary
.
I am also extremely interested in teaching.


Personal Interests

I am a huge fan of games and puzzles of any type.
I've made up a
page
giving some of my favorite
sites and presenting puzzles that I've created. If you're a fan of Monopoly,
