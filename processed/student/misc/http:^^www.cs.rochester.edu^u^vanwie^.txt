Would you buy a used car from this man?




, just a short time ago,
I was a mild-mannered programmer, counting the hours until payday, investing
my time in such vital concerns as sleeping, eating, and watching
major league baseball.  Sadly, those days are gone.  Now they call me:
Mike Van Wie, URCS Grad Student
and I spend most of my time trying not to work on my web page.  Alas,
I couldn't avoid it forever, and when not one but
two
first-year
students finished theirs, I was finally shamed into writing this.
Oh, it's modest yet, and I'm still getting the hang of working with html.
But soon --
soon
-- I'll have a real web page.
And then you'll
all
be sorry.
