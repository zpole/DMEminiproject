I've always thought these bios are lame, but then I realized: What else goes on a
home page about me?
I got a degree in Math and CS from
U.Penn
in 1995,
then came here that fall.  I'm
interested in Natural Language and Knowledge Representation, and I anticipate
working on the
TRAINS project
over the next few years.
OK.  That's the briefest of the brief.  Here are some
links
I've found interesting/useful.

CSC108
I'm also TA'ing
CSC108
this term.
For some helpful info and pointers (but beware of policies that are
specific to his lab), check out
Amit Singhal's 108 web page
.  Also
on line are
grades for my Cooperative
Learning section
of 108, organized by the last 4 digits of your
Student ID number.  Note that you should refer to the
grading policy
for the course first if you have any questions.

For those who have figured out the web but not email, send me mail this way:
