Mark Gaynor Graduate Student in
Computer Science
at
Harvard
I am a second year graduate student working on networking with HT
Kung. My research interests are high-speed networking (in particular,
ATM) and general operating system support for giga-bit networks. I
moved to Cambridge from Boulder Colorado last summer with my wife,
Gretchen, and our two Yr. old son Neil. You might ask, how at 39 I became a
graduate student. Its really very simple. After working in the
telecommunications field for 15 years and completing a Masters degree
in telecommunications I realized that school was the best place to
be. So, I decided to finish up the century as a student.
