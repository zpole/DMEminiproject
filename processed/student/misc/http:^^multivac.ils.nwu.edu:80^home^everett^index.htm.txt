Research

I currently work with
Professor
Kenneth D. Forbus
at
Northwestern University's

Institute for the Learning Sciences
.
For my dissertation research, I am developing a theory of teleological
reasoning, that is, inferring the intended function of a system given its
structural description. I am implementing a system called CARNOT that applies
this theory to the domain of steady-state thermodynamic cycles such as
refrigerators and heat engines in order to develop functional explanations
from their schematic descriptions. As part of my dissertation work I am
building a CARNOT-based coach for tutoring undergraduate engineering students
in their first and second courses in thermodynamics. This coach will become
a part of
CyclePad
, an
articulate virtual laboratory
for teaching engineering thermodynamics. Another potential application
of this work would be an automatic indexer that could categorize and retrieve
CAD/CAM schematics according to their function.

Not Research

I particularly enjoy
skiing
.
I grew up skiing at
Hunter Mountain
in New York State, but nothing beats the American West. I have been on
two
National Outdoor Leadership School
wilderness courses, one in the
Wind
River Range of the Rocky Mountains
, and the other sea kayaking in
Alaska's
Prince William Sound
. I have a visual flight rules private pilot's
license. And finally, I enjoy
woodworking
,
when I have the time. I've found that there's a wealth of information on
the web for woodworkers. In particular, check out
The
Woodworking Catalog
and
Woodworking
on the World Wide Web
. Last fall I built the
desk
I'm working at right now.
