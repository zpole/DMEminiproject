Research Interests & Background:

My academic interests are in mathematical modeling of various
human activities, and in attempts at finding relationships between
topics which had been considered independent. The former includes
Computational Linguistics, Artificial Life, Game Theory, and
Artificial Intelligence.
I was impressed by the early attempts in A.I., which
motivated me to decide to major in Computer Science. These attempts are
interesting also because, I believe, they are the attempts of finding
novel relations among mathematics, linguistics, philosophy, and
engineering.

The work I did as my master thesis at Kyoto University, is my attempt of
establishing an original relation between Information Theory
(specifically universal code of integers) and Information Retrieval
(fast string-matching). I applied a code which had been discussed as a
method of universal coding of integers, with revision, to accelerate
string-matching.

Now, I am interested in mathematical(or statistical) features in
linguistic phenomena. And from the viewpoint of engineering, I am
also interested in the application of statistical methods to Natural
Language Processing.
