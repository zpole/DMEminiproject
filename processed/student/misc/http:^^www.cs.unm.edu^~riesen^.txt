``Who is this General Failure and what's he doing on my
harddisk?''
(Seen somewhere on the net)




My personality is split between being an employee of
Sandia National Laboratories
and
being a Ph.D. student at
UNM
.
At work I'm involved with the
SUNMOS/Puma
project. If you are interested in a small, scalable, performance oriented,
and unique operating system, then you should have a look at our work.
At UNM, Herr Doktor Professor
Barney Maccabe
is my advisor.
I got my funny sounding name and accent in
Switzerland
where I
grew up. My last name is pronounced just like the English word
reason
, while my first name is pronounced with an open "o", as
in roll.
Have a look at my
family album (361 kB)
and
some pictures of our last
vacation (334 kB)
.
Here is a list of
WEB sites (26 kB)
I find interesting.
I'm and avid sports fan (Not!) and here you can see me
