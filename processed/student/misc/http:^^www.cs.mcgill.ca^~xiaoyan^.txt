Database Programming

relational algebra
computation--a procedure abstraction in relational database system

File Systems
Exploring more efficient data structures for files with symmetric

clustering properties,
low retrieval times,
distribution independent,
high storage utilization, and
low maintenance and update cost.
Well, do you think it's possible?? What kind of data structure is this? If
