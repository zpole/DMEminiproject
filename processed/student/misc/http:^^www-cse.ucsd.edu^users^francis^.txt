Francis Zane




Welcome...

And what have we here?  Why it's a homepage for Francis Zane and
Donna Bell (complete with a few images, for those who complained
endlessly about the prior version.)  Yes, it's true - having long ago
run out of space in our tiny apartment, we've overflowed online.  So
welcome
, weary net traveller, to our virtual home.
Francis, for the unaware, is a fourth year graduate student in
Computer Science and Engineering
at
UCSD
.  He works with
Mohan Paturi
on some
circuit complexity problems and with some folks in the
ECE Department
on applications
of optoelectronic computing.
Donna is also employed by UCSD, just down the hill at scenic
Scripps Institute of Oceanography
.
It is very curious, and not a little bit ironic, that a freckled
redhead with an aversion to sunlight ended up in this sunny
paradise.  Singlehandedly supporting the sunscreen industry, Donna has
even been dragged out to lunchtime beach volleyball practice.  Newt
would be proud.

Together, harassed by San Diego's vicious climate, our heroes
battle against incredible odds, vanquish evil, enjoy music, take in a
little hiking, and practice
Tai
Chi
.  (Well, the latter is one of Francis' accomplishments.  Donna
prefers to perfect her napping skills.)
