W
elcome to
Jean's homepage
.
I am a MS student in
Computer Science department
at
Columbia University
,
New York.
Since May 1996, I've been working
on internet-based client/server projects at
Bell Laboratories
,
Lucent Technologies
.
I am interested in searching, organizing, and finally using the
multimedia data spread over the internet. The project
WebUs
proposed on September 28, 1996
is
VOD in the WWW using RTP and H.263 compression
.
We'll see how fast Java decoder can run to suffice our goal, real-time
video on-demand service over the internet.


Always under constructions.
