CS 395T: Web Operating Systems





CS 395T: Web Operating Systems

unique no. 47928 MWF 1:00-2:00 TAY 3.144

The recent explosion of interest in the world wide web has resulted
in an evolving set of protocols for using it. These protocols address the
traditional concerns of operating systems -- interprocess communication,
resource allocation, security, etc. -- but do so in the more general context
of the Internet. The goal of this class is to provide an understanding
of the current state of the art in web operating systems and also to address
problems that must be solved to provide a mature, general-purpose web operating
system.

A key hypothesis behind the design of this class is that many of the
issues now being addressed in the context of the web also have been addressed
in other, more traditional, areas of operating systems. We will occasionally
read non-web related papers that may have some bearing on understanding
current web problems.
