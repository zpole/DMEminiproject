CSE643: Principles of Parallel Computing


CSE 643: Principles of Parallel Computing

(This page is under construction)
This course gives a comprehensive study of the fundamentals
and research frontiers of parallel computing.
Topics include parallel algorithms,
new computing paradigm of shared-memory, distributed-memory,
data-parallel and data-flow models,
techniques to improve parallelism, scheduling theory,
and interconnection networks.
Instructor



Dr. Edwin Sha
(esha@bach.helios.nd.edu)

Goals


Study issues on hardware, software and theory
for parallel processing.

Hardware: Archetectures, Cache-coherence, Routings,
Interconnection networks, etc.
Software: Shared-memory, Message-passing, Data-parallel models,
Parallel Compiler, etc.
Theory: Parallel Algorithms, Scheduling, Partitioning, Parallelism, etc.

Give students
hand-on experience in several parallel machines in NSF Supercomuter Centers
such as NCSA 512-node CM5, Cornell 512-node IBM/SP2, Pittsburgh Cray T3D, etc.
Programming based on different models and tools such as message-passing,
shared-memory, data-parallel, MPI, PVM, etc.
