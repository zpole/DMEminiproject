EECS 487 Home Page


















EECS 487:

The very first
official
announcement for EECS 487: THE WEB PAGE
IS IN A DECENT STAGE!  But being the lonely TA doing the web page, I may
make a mistake.  Please feel free to email me (oh no, hyperlink ->
dnguyen@eecs.umich.edu
and tell me what should be changed (mispelling, design style, whatever).
OK, let's have some fun!  (I know, I know...  but the math thing won't
last forever...)



Prize!! Prize!!

The first person to come up to me and say, "Purple cows are like blue moons."
wins an SGI yoyo.  Financially stricken grad students like myself usually
only have enough $$$ to give out yoyo's...



Office Hours:

Not like anyone cares...  Poor little old me was twiddling my thumbs all
by myself last Tuesday at office hours (5:30-7:00).  No more!  I've got a
better idea:  I'm having office hours at the Media Union (so I can at least
play with email).
Check out the
Office Hours
page for
the plan
!!



Textbooks:

The texts have been ordered!!  Rumor has it that the text can be found at
Michigan Books & Supplies
.  Could someone please confirm that for me?



Overrides:

My bad!  Anyone who was on the waiting list still has to sign the override
list.  But!  The good news is that everyone can join the fun (fun is coming;
trust me...)
