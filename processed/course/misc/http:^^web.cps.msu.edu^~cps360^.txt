Outline
The goal of this course is tying various models of computation:
Machines, Grammars, Functions, and Languages.  Understanding the
relationship among them is essential to any further study of computer
science. Machines can be viewed as models of computation.  We study
various types of machines and their power, and limitations.  Grammars
are proposed to describe the languages accpeted by these machines.
Finding the relationships and proving properties require formal
approaches.  We will also show how these theories can be applied in
various branches of computer science.  To demonstrate how the course
is applicable to other areas, and to enhance the understanding of
materials, programming assignments will be given.
