Tools



DLX toolset
: dlxsim (DLX simulator), dlxcc (gcc cross-compiler,
generates DLX code), dinero (cache simulator on DLX traces).  They are
installed in CS LAN and should be in your path. Dlxsim documentation is
available
here.
Dlxcc has a man page. Dinero
documentation is available
here.
. If you need the
source codes, they are
available in /usr/local/courses/cs5513 on CS LAN.


Shade
: a SPARC instruction set simulation, analysis and
tracing tool.  Installed in /usr/local/src/simulators/spat/ on CS LAN.
Look around the shade.v8 directory for documentation. The documents you
will need are "Introduction to Shade" and "Shade Users' Manual." There
are some analyzers (such as ifreq, icount, cachesim5) that are already
supplied.  The executables to be used on Solaris/SPARC (any non
UltraSPARC) platform are in shade.v8.elf directory. There are also
source files and makefiles.
