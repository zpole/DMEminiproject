Communication
The course newsgroup,
ac.csci.s212
, will be
used to post announcements and important information.  Please feel
free to post questions related to the course, answer the questions of
others, and share related information with the class.  Do not post
anonomously. Make a habit of looking for new notes every day.
On individual or immediate matters, contact your instructor or
associate instructor via email. You might also want to regularly read
cs.students
for postings pertinent to
students in our CS department.


Course Content
This course is an introduction to application development in the Unix
environment using the C++ language.
We will cover the following topics:

basic Unix

control structures, functions, arrays, structs

I/O streams, strings, pointers, references, bits

OO concepts, objects, classes, methods, messages

function overloading, constructors, destructors

dynamic memory allocations, recursive data structures

inheritance, polymorphism, templates

linking external libraries, makefile

shell programming, processes, signals, pipes

A
detailed course outline
, with
week-by-week course schedule, is also abuilding.


Textbooks

Participation
Participation
in the class can take many forms: attendence at lectures and
discussions, asking and answering questions posed in class and on the
newsgroup, and participating in group activities during lecture.  In
addition, there will be homework problems assigned in lecture that
will be due the following lecture.  These problem sets will be short,
hand-written and may not always be collected.


Quizzes and Exams
There will two 30-minute quizzes early on, and
two 50-minute quizzes given at four week intervals:


January 24

February 14

February 26 (midterm)

March 29


The final exam will be held in the regular classroom.  The exam is on

Friday, May 3 at 8 - 10 a.m.



Grading
Grades are calculated as follows:

Quizzes 25%

Participation 10%

Projects 40%

Final 25%

Note: You must pass the final exam to pass the course!
The
course
gradebook
will be updated regularly.


Programming Projects
This is the most important component to the course.  There will be a
project due every week.  Most projects will entail writing several
small programs.
You will submit your source code electronically using the S212
handin
program.  This
handin
program does not compile, run, debug, or test your
code (that's your job); it merely saves your file in a convenient
location so your AI can grade it later.  Submit ASCII source code
files only!  Never submit object or executable code, please!  You may
submit a program as many times as you want up to the deadline. Only
your last submission will be graded.
All programs must run under g++.  It is recommended that you use the
UCS machine named
copper
.  Programs will be judged on
correctness, completeness, efficiency, generality, and aesthetics.
Programs that do not compile will earn zero points.
Project descriptions will appear below as they are assigned.  In
general, solutions to the programming projects will
not
be
supplied.
Projects are due by 11:59 p.m., according to the system clock, on the
specified date. There is no grace period following this deadline.
Programs submitted late, even just one second, will not be accepted.

Course Evaluations
Course evaluations will be performed electronically.  At some point
you should receive an email message containing your individual
password, which you'll need to gain entry into the system.  As the end
of the semester approaches, we'll provide a link into the evaluation
system.

Miscellaneous


`Incompletes' are given only because of an unforeseen emergency
that is preceded by diligent work, not for a pattern of weak performance.
No student will be allowed to do ``extra work'' to raise his final
grade or to make up missing work.  The last day (until 4 p.m.) to
withdraw with an automatic W is Wednesday, March 6, 1996.

Programs are due on the announced date, because solutions
may be discussed immediately thereafter;  late assignments would
be accepted
only under the conditions similar to what could justify an Incomplete.
All grades become final one week after the material is returned
to you. No claims, however justifiable, will be considered after this
deadline.  If there is a medical or personal reason requiring you to miss a
quiz you must present your excuse in advance and in writing.  In all
cases, we require some physical proof of your claim.

You are expected to complete all work independently.  Joint work
of any type is simply not permitted.  Read the Computer Science
Department's

Statement on Academic Integrity
to be sure you understand
the rules under which CS courses operate.  Cases of academic
dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Ethics, a branch
of the Office of the Dean of Students.
