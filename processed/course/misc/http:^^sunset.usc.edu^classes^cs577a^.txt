Fall 1996 Course CSCI 577a



Fall 1996 Course CS577a



Design and Construction of Large Software Systems:

Software Engineering I - Plans, Processes, Requirements, and
Architectures


Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software products, interactive networked
information systems, new management approaches, and new process models are
significantly changing the nature of software engineering.
This course is focused on enabling students to understand and apply these new
software engineering approaches. Its learning objectives are to enable students
to understand the principles underlying postmodern software engineering; to
master the use of tools supporting the new approaches; and to apply the tools
and principles on a real-world team project.
This years project involves the determination and architecting of high-value
multimedia capabilities for USC's Library Information System. In CS577a, the
student team members will formulate operational concepts, requirements
specifications, architectures, prototypes, life cycle plans, and integrating
rationale for the proposed capabilities. In CS577b, we plan to have student
teams develop experimental system capabilities based on the best concepts
emerging form CS577a.
