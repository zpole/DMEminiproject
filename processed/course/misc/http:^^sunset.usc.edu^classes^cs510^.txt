Software Management and Economics



Successful software projects need to deal with people and
economic considerations, as well as technical considerations.  The learning
objectives of this course are to enable the student to understand the
fundamental principles underlying software management and economics; to analyze
management situations via case studies; to analyze software cost/schedule
tradeoff issues via software cost estimation tools and microeconomic
techniques; and to apply the principles and techniques to practical situations.
CS510 is one of the mainstream courses in the Master of Science in Computer
Science with specialization in Software Engineering.
