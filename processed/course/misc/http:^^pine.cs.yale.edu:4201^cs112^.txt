CptSci 112a Home Page

This is the World-Wide Web home page for Computer Science 112a:
Introduction to Pascal.  Here you can find pointers to various
resources for students taking the course.  You should check this
page periodically for new announcements.

Error in HW9 handout

The printed version of HW9 incorrectly describes the location
of the
Zone Size
control in Think Pascal.  The correct
location is on the
Run Options
page off the
Run
menu.  The on-line version of the handout now has the
correct information.

Staff information


Jim
Aspnes
has office hours in AKW 410 by appointment.  His phone
number is 2-1232 and his email address is

Dunham Circus

The Dunham Circus is a public cluster in the same building as
the lectures; if you go down the stairs leading out of DL220
and keep going straight you will reach the doors to the
Circus.  Normally the Circus is kept locked, but you can get
your ID validated so
that you can open it by bringing it to Lori Hammel in AKW 009a
(knocking also works, sometimes.)

LifeLab

If you aren't sick of Life after HW6, you might be interested
in playing with LifeLab, a very fast shareware implementation of
Life for the Macintosh that includes a library of interesting
patterns that can be loaded from the disk.  You can download it
to your desktop from Netscape by clicking
this link
.  Look in the
LifeLab
3.1
folder for the actual program.
Or you can grab it out of
the CS112 folder in the Instructional Computing fileserver.

Programs for other types of machines can be found in
Paul
Callahan's collection of life resources.
