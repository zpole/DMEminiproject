Description

Introduction to compiler construction (emphasis on compiler front ends).
Course contents include the following:  Formal translation of programming
languages, program syntax and semantics.  Finite state recognizers and
regular grammars.  Context-free parsing techniques such as LL(k) and LR(k).
Type checking, code generation, improvement, syntax-directed translation
schema.
