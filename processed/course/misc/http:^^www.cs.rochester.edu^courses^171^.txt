CSC 171: Computer Programming

Programming computers is a skill central to Computer Science.  This
skill involves translating algorithms, sequences of simple steps that
have complex results, into programs that can be followed by a
computer.  High level languages facilitate this translation by
allowing programmers to express their algorithms in a form natural to
the people using the algorithms.  Like writing essays, programming in
high level languages is a skill that is best learned by reading well
written programs and trying to emulate them.  Also, like essays, the
criterion for a well written program is that it others can understand
it.
