About the course

CS1001 Introduction to Computers is an introductory course intended
primarily for those not planning to do further work in computer science.
The course will focus on some of the many ways that one can use a
computer.  We will study how to use email, how to access and post to
newsgroups and other resources on the Internet.  Our major focus for this
semester, however, is to write programs.  We will use the Scheme, a
dialect of the LISP programming language to solve problems and accomplish
tasks.  Another goal for this course is to make you, the user, "computer
literate: so that you will be familiar with the common jargon of computer
folks and have a sense of the historical development of computing.
