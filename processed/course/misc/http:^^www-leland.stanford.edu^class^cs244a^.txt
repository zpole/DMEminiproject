Course Information


General
Cs244a is a very project oriented course. A
large part of the grade comes from the programming projects.

Prerequisites.
Cs240a is
not
required as a prerequisite for Cs244a. However, a
strong background in C programming on Unix systems is essential.

Project Guidelines

These are the general rules and requirements for the programming
assignments. They will give you an idea of what we will expect of students
for this course.

Last year's web page

Although the course structure and assignments will be slightly different
this year, you can get some indication of the level of work required by
looking at last year's page.

Required texts


1.Communication Networks:  A First Course
,        Walrand
Please do not buy this book before the quarter begins as there may
be a second edition available by then.


2.UNIX Network Programming
,                       Stevens


SITN Information

SITN students who do not come to class have the same deadlines for the
projects as the local students; i.e., there will be no 7 day grace period.
SITN will endeavor to get videotapes to you ASAP.
SITN students are very strongly encouraged to use
ADEPT
, which makes lectures
available over the World Wide Web. This obviates
the need to wait for videotapes of the lectures.
