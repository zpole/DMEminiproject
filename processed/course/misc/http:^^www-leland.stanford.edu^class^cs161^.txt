Course Overview
This is a basic course on the design and analysis of algorithms.
The course will focus on both general classes of
algorithms, such as dynamic programming, divide
and conquer, and greedy methods; and advanced data
structures, such as balanced trees, graphs, and heaps.  In addition, we
will compare different algorithms formally by analyzing their complexity
(i.e. running time).  The problems we will study involve sorting,
searching, graph algorithms, computational geometry, and a sprinkling
of other topics which vary from year to year.



Prerequisites

The official prerequisite for this course is CS109AB (Introduction to
Computer Science) or equivalent.  Although this course will be
entirely a ``pen-and-paper'' course, (i.e. no programming),
familiarity with programming concepts such as pointers, arrays,
records, procedures, and recursion will be assumed.

In addition, a solid background in mathematics will prove invaluable
for this course, in that we will argue formally about the correctness
and performance of almost every algorithm and data structure
introduced.  The ability to write clear, formal, and BRIEF proofs will be
relied upon (especially by the TA).
