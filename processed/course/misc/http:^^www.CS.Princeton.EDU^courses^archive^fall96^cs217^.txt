Schedule and Readings
The lecture meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from 9:00am to 9:50am
in room 104. You should attend one precept each week. You can choose
one among the following:

Wednesday, 3:30pm to 4:20pm, Angelos, 302
Wednesday, 7:30pm to 8:20pm, Ben, 102
Thursday, 2:30pm to 3:20pm, Tassos, 402
Friday, 11:00am to 11:50am, Wagner, 302

You should try to keep going to the same precept as far as possible
since that's how you will be judged for participation (of course if you
miss one you are allowed to go to another).
If you can not attend any of these precepts, see Professor Singh as
soon as possible.

A tentative schedule and reading list.

Quizzes & Exams
There will be a midterm exam.  In addition, there
will be quizzes from time to time.   Quizzes will be
announced beforehand.  The midterm will be on Wednesday
Nov 6 in class.

Sample questions from last year's
midterm.
We will administer make-up quizzes only in the case
of documented illnesses. (We do not consider a broken alarm clock to
be a documentable illness, even though the alarm clocks at Princeton
seem to be suffering from some sort of epidemic.)
Programming Assignments
There will be weekly programming assignments, which  will be due on
Mondays at 11:59pm.  You are expected to submit your work
(electronically)
before
this time.  Late work will
lose credit on the following scale:


15% for work submitted before Noon on Tuesday,
25% for work submitted before 11:59pm on Tuesday,
50% for work submitted before 11:59pm on Wednesday.
Work submitted after 11:59pm on Wednesday will receive no credit.

If you have specific extenuating circumstances requiring you to
hand something in late, you should consult Professor Singh
before
the due date.
Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process.
Individuals must reach their own understanding of the problem and
discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with
friends are encouraged.  However, when the time comes to write the code
that solves the problem, such discussions are no longer appropriate -
the program must be your own work (although you may ask teaching
assistants for help in debugging).  If you have a question about how to
use some feature of C, UNIX, etc., then you can certainly ask your
friends or the teaching assistants.

Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's
program
.  Writing code for use by another or using another's
code in any form violates the University's academic regulations.
You are responsible for insuring your files are
not
readable by your classmates.  We recommend doing
all your CS217 work in a private subdirectory, i.e.:

% mkdir cs217
% chmod 700 cs217



List of programming assignments


Assignment 1:
Changing Strings

Write
change
: Given two strings,
change
copies
lines from the standard input to the standard output replacing all
occurrences of the first string by the second.

Due: submitted by 11:59pm, Monday, 09/23.


Sample
Solution

Assignment 2:
Generating WWW Listings

Write
c2html
, a program that generating Hypertext to
render a listing of its file arguments suitable for browsing with a
World Wide Web browser.

Due: submitted by 11:59pm, Tuesday, 10/01.


Sample
Solution

Assignment 3:
Using an ADT: Word
Frequencies

Write
freq [
options ...
] [
files
...
]
, a program that prints, on the standard output, a list
of the characters, words and lines that appear in its file arguments
and the number of times each appears.  A tab separates each frequency
from its character, word, or line.  It first prints all characters,
then all words, and then all lines, with a blank line between each
set. If there are no file arguments,
freq
reads from the
standard input.


Due: submitted by 11:59pm, Friday, 10/18.

list.c
file.

Due: submitted by 11:59pm, Friday, 10/25.


Sample
Solution

Assignment 5:
Implementing
"tail" in SPARC Assembly Language

Write a program, in SPARC assembly language, to print the
