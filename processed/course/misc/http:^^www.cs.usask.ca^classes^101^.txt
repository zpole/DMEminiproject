Assignment #4 is available for everybody to get started on.  There
are a few details and corrections which are still being worked out.  I
will be available in the Alibaba lab on Friday, March 29th from 12:00
until 1:00 for any 101 students who require assistance.  This
assignment is much more demanding than the exercises and assignments
in the past, so don't leave it until the last night.
