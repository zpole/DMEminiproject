CIS607 Quantum Computing




CIS 607, Fall 1996

Quantum Computing Seminar



The purpose of this page is to provide some web links relevant to the
seminar on quantum computing.

In the directory /cs/classes/cis607theory/papers/ you can find
downloaded copies of some relevant papers.  Admittedly, this is of
no help for those of you on machines outside the CIS department.

If you have downloaded a potentially interesting paper, feel free
to move or copy it to that directory (and amend the README file
appropriately).  This can help avoid saving multiple copies of
these files.

The followng links were provided by Bill Kantor:

for SHOR'S factoring algorithm presented perhaps more slowly.
This all would need to be printed out, I suppose.  But it starts out assuming you know what
dopant impurities
are??
also
http://eve.physics.ox.ac.uk/QCresearch/communication/communication.html

long list in
http://feynman.stanford.edu/qcomp/artlist.html

tooooo much stuff
and seems to require SOMEONE whol knows some physics just to
translate the lingo.

There is also a
Scientific American article
which itself is short but has some interesting looking links
(which are likely duplicated above).
Here is a link to the
Measurement in quantum mechanics FAQ
.

Charlie Wright mentions, concerning a tutorial available from a site
in Israel:
The tutorial looks eminently readable to me, and not as frighteningly
technical as it might at first appear. [Ignore the stuff about doping.]
It takes FOREVER to download it from Israel, but it's quite fast to get
from
www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~schmuel
