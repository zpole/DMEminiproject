CPS 440, Undergraduate Intro to AI, Fall 96




CPS 440, Undergrad Intro to AI, Fall 96

This is the CPS 440 web page. CPS 440 is the intro to AI undergrad course.
As described in the course book, cps440 is supposed to be about:


Machine intelligence. Heuristic programming. Representation and control
in LISP and PROLOG. Applications to search, rule-based diagnosis, and parsing


with the objectives:


Study classic problems and approaches in machine intelligence. Symbolic
and heuristic information processing. Obtain minimum competence in LISP
programming. Develop foundations for further work in artificial intelligence.


The difference this year is that we will be using
Java
as a programming
language instead of lisp and prolog. These pages are here to support the
class, this new language and to provide extra materials for the course.
Make sure you stop in here to get updates on things going on in the class.


Class Materials



Class Syllabus
in
text form.


A Java white paper
in
postscript format.


Lab0.5
, the
first lab, and an
example
solution
.


Lab0.9
, another
warm-up lab, and an
example
solution


Lab1
, recursion
and ai search, the triangle puzzle, and an
an
example solution
.


Lab2,
a simple
backward-chaining rule system, and a
a
solution
, with an
example
ruleset
and an
example
hypotheses
set.


Lab3,
a frame
data base. File is postscript. The
fixed
version
of the lab.


Lab4,
an interactive
game that you design (in postscript). The
tank
interface
can be found here. The javadoc descriptions for
Tank
and for
GameStatus
can also be found here, as well as information on running the
Tank
simulator and demos
and some
sample
Tank classes
.


Lab Last,
A deterministic FSA parser.
Other stuff


Sample Report
for the lab reports you must turn in.
