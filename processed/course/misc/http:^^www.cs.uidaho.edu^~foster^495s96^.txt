which computes the closed form for a linear
homogenous recurrence relation when you give it the roots and
multiplicities of the characteristic polynomial.  Feel free to copy it
over and play with it.

Grades will be determined approximately as follows:

Midterm: 30%
Final: 35%
Project: 25%
Homework: 10%
Classroom participation will be considered, too.
Programming Project
In this course, we implement three programs for the three processor
scheduling problem.  One uses a simple exhaustive search, another uses
backtracking, and the third uses branch and bound.  For details, see
the
project description
.
Here is a description of the criteria by which project papers are graded,
and
hints for getting a higher grade
.

Homework

There will be approximately eight homework assignments (every two weeks).
However, these will be graded on a pass/fail basis, where students who
turn in the homeworks and make a genuine effort will pass.
I will provide solutions.
Here are the homework assignments for this semester:
