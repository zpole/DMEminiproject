Lecture:

Tuesday, Thursday, 117 DeBartolo Hall, 11:00-12:15

Laboratory:

The CSE Design Automation Laboratory in Room 245 Cushing Hall,
containing three Sun SPARC workstations will be used in this course. In
addition, the workstations in the College of Engineering Computer Laboratory
will be used. Software is available for schematic capture, hardware description
languages, simulaiton, and realization with standard ICs and Xilinx FPGAs. A
Xilinx FPGA demonstration circuit board will be loaned to each design group.
