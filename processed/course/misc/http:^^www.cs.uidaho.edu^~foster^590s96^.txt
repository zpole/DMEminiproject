Instructor:
Dr. James A. Foster

This course covers the fundamentals of recursive function theory and
the theory of computational complexity.  That is, we examine the
inherent limitations of computation, both theoretical and practical,
in some detail.
For more details, see the
course syllabus

Texts



Computational Complexity
, Bovet and Crescenzi. Prentice Hall, 1994.

Computability: An Introduction to Recursive Function Theory
, Cutland.  Cambridge, 1980.

Objectives


To be able to describe two mathematical models of computation: URM and TM
To derive some properties of computation from these models (such as inherent limitations)
To be able to characterize computational feasibility and infeasibility
To understand some current research topics in theoretical CS

Activities
Lectures, two tests, several (up to 8) homework assignments, discussions.
Grading
Grades will be determined approximately as follows: 50% from the
Midterm examination and 50% from the final examination (which will
not
be cumulative).

There will be no more than 8 homework assignments (one every two weeks).
These will be suggested exercises to help you understand definitions and results.
I will check
your homework to be sure that you are making a good-faith effort, but
will not grade it---hence, it does not contribute to your grade.
You will understand the material best if you do the homework.
I will provide solutions to all homework problems.
See the
course notes from last year
for the homework last year.


Tests
Here are some sample tests from previous years.

1993 Midterm

1993 Final

Sample test questions for the 1994 Midterm
