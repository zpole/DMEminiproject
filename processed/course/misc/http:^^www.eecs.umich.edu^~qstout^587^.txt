EECS 587, Parallel Computing

Instructor:
Quentin F. Stout





Parallel computers are easy to build - it's the software that takes work.



Note: As of 4 September 1996,
students wanting to enroll in this class will have to go
through the waitlist procedure.  Lists of such students will be collected
in class.  As long as seats are available in the room, people will be permitted
to add the course up until the drop/add deadline.



Meeting Time, Place:

9:30-10:30,
EECS 3427

Texts:

None, but you will need to
buy some computer manuals and you will have lots of papers to read.
(Of course, you could always buy the professor's new
book
, but it is
not really relevant to the course.)

Grading:

Based on homeworks,
computer projects, and a final project of your choosing (though I must
approve it).

Prerequisites:

Ability to program
well in C or Fortran, plus some ability to analyze programs, plus
willingness to rethink how problems should be solved

Computing Resources:

We will use
the parallel machines in the
Center for Parallel Computing
(CPC) here at the
University of Michigan.

Class Email:

Every student needs to
join the email group, eecs587@umich.edu
Various announcements and last-minute changes will be sent out via
email.

Class Homepage:

http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~qstout/587/

Happy Hour:

Everyone in this class is
invited to the weekly happy hour sponsored by
(CSEG)
(the Computer Science and Engineering Graduate Student Organization).
It meets 4:30 until ?, usually in 3128 EECS.

Jobs:

There are many jobs
available in parallel computing.  I'll make lists of these available
as the semester progresses.

Net Resources:

There are a lot
of parallel computing resources available on the Net, and as the
semester progresses I'll give you pointers to some of them.

Conferences:

There are a great many
conferences on parallel computing, and vastly more conferences where there
are special sessions on parallel computing for various applications.
Here are some recent
conference announcements
of interest.
