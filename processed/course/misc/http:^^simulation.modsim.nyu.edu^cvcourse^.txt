Computer Vision G22.2270 Fall 96




Computer Vision G22.2270

This is the source for information about the Computer Vision course,
G22.2270, Fall 1996, at New York University. This course is taught
by
Professor Robert Hummel
.
Outline

The course outline is found in
outline.txt
.
You'll find comments on the course content, the course textbook,
and a sketch of the intended schedule in this file. In
email_list.txt
,
you will find a list of the email addresses of all students associated
with the course. The usernames associated with ACF logins are
given in
login_names.txt
.
Khoros

We intend on making use of the Khoros image processing system.
Initially, we want to use the DIP (Digital Image Processing) course.
This is available only under Khoros 2.0, although later in the
course, we want to make use of Khoros 2.1. First, you need to
set up your account to access Khoros 2.0. Instructions for doing
this are found in
khoros_instructions.txt
.
In order to use Khoros, or to use netscape for that matter, you
need to set up your X server. Use the instructions in
x_instructions.txt
to do that.
DIP Course

You should be able to learn a lot about image processing and computer
vision from the online DIP course. To run it, follow the instructions
in
dip_instructions.txt
.

Midterm Projects

As a midterm, all students are expected to implement a simple Khoros
workspace to perform a simple image processing function.  Here are
some sample
projects
to suggest the kinds
of things that can be done.
