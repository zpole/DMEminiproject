reasoning emphasizing circumscription,  applications to formalizing
common sense knowledge and reasoning,  situation calculus and its
variants,  formalizing context, and  formalizing facts about knowledge.
We will assign 4
homeworks
throughout
the quarter and possibly a short paper
at the end.  There will be no final or any other tests.  All the assignments,
updates, and other relevant information will be added to this page.
There is also an attached page on the
students
taking the course.
Readings: we require the book by John McCarthy,
Formalizing
Common Sense
, Ablex 1990, which is available at the bookstore.
We have prepared a
course
reader
which contains other relevant papers in electronic
form.  Sections of
lecture notes
from the previous years might also be of interest;
these too are available in electronic form.
McCarthy's home page
contains a number of papers on
logical AI, both published and unpublished.
The papers from the 1996 January symposium on Logical
Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning relate to the subject matter
of this course.  They are accessible from the
Formal Reasoning Group
home page.
