Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence

Background
We will review some advanced topics in artificial intelligence:
planning, reasoning under uncertainty, decision making, vision,
robotics, reinforcement learning.  Topics will be almost entirely
disjoint from those of CPS270, so students that have taken CPS270 are
welcome to take this class as well.

Textbook
Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.  (1995).
Artificial
Intelligence: A Modern Approach
.  Prentice-Hall, Englewood
Cliffs, New Jersey. (

page
)
Note that Curry Guinn used the same book in
CPS170
last year.
From what I can tell, the overlap between the two courses (after the
initial introductory material) is quite small.
Prerequisites
I will assume that students are familiar with programming (any
language), algorithm analysis (big O notation and the like at the
level of CPS130), and simple calculus (derivatives).


Grading
Class grade will be based on:

written homework assignments (20%),
programming projects (20%),
two in-class exams (30%), and
a final exam (30%).



Outline
I'm going to follow the suggested syllabus in the textbook for a
one-semeter course with concentration on vision and robotics.  Here
are the chapters we'll cover.

I. Artificial Intelligence

1. Introduction
2. Intelligent Agents

II. Problem Solving

3. Solving Problems by Searching
4. Informed Search Methods

III. Knowledge and Reasoning

6. Agents that Reason Logically
7. First-Order Logic

IV. Acting Logically

11. Planning
13. Planning and Acting

V. Uncertain Knowledge and Reasoning

14. Uncertainty
15. Probabilistic Reasoning Systems
16. Making Simple Decisions
17. Making Complex Decisions

VI. Learning

20. Reinforcement Learning

VII. Communicating, Perceiving, and Acting

24. Perception
25. Robotics
