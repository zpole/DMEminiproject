More advanced stuff
(Greg may choose to extend this
later).
After reading the Survival Guide, the student must start reading the
course reader. Class instructors will assign readings each week.

We recommend that in the first few weeks, you do all your programming
in the labs when the lab TAs are around. This way you can get help whenever
you need it. Later in the semester,
we will hold a special help session for those who wish to use their
PCs to do assignments.
