Course Outline

Computer programming in the language Pascal
Decision trees

Text manipulation

Numerical computation

Top down programming and subroutines

Software engineering


Understanding what a computer is and how it works
Electric circuits

Machine architecture

Language translation

Operating systems

Computer networking (setting up your own home page)

Who Should Take This Course
This course is designed for students who have little or no experience in computer science and who want a general overview of the field.  Little or no mathematical background is required.
However, students should be prepared for a rigorous coverage of computing including extensive programming, detailed studies of the internals of the computer, and various advanced topics.
Students should be prepared to learn several mathematial notations in the course and to use them extensively.



Announcements

This is kind of an informal section on the web page where I (Eric) will
try to post class gossip and info about what's going on.

old news


Anyone who scored 80 or higher on the midterm is exempt from the lab
final.  However, you can still take it if you wish to use it to raise your
grade.  The lab final will probably be the week after Thanksgiving but
that's just my best guess--I haven't discussed it with Dr. Biermann
yet.


The final exam for this class is on Wednesday, 18 December from 7 to 10
PM.  Here's the
whole schedule
.


We've decided that the T-F question on the quiz about right-clicking to
download an image was poorly worded. If you lost half a point on this
question, bring your quiz by my office in D328 (or slip it under the door)
and I'll fix your grade.  -Steve


It's about time to be registering for classes for spring... if anyone is
interested in taking more cps classes or in becoming a cps major and
would like to talk to a fellow undergrad who has taken all the classes
and is a major...
send me mail
or
talk to me in lab or after class.

Policies

Each student must write his or her own programs without help from other persons.  After a program is typed into a machine, students may help each other to find bugs but not to write new code.
Homework problems must be done without help from others.

No make-up exams will be given.  If an exam is missed for reasons beyond the student's control, a written excuse should be handed in.  The final grade will be based on the other scores earned.

The lowest two quizzes will not be counted.  No make-up quizzes will be given.  If a quiz is missed for an excusable reason, be sure to hand in a written excuse.  The quiz average will be based on the quizzes actually taken.

Late homeworks, programs, or labs will receive 80% of full credit if they are handed in within seven days o the regular due date.  After seven days, no credit will be given except in unusual circumstances.

The grade of
I
(incomplete) will be administered as specified by University rules.  Thus it will be not given to those students who simply did not complete the course on time.

Unethical practices by any student (such as copying on an exam or homework) will be dealt with strictly, usually by turning the case over to the Judicial Board.
(Special caution: often two or more versions of the quizzes or exams are given on a given day.  Thus your neighbor may be taking a different test from you.)

The final exam is not optional and every student will be required to take it at the scheduled time unless a written excuse from the Dean is presented.

Students who receive 85% or higher on the midterm exam may skip the lab final programming test.  Their final grades will be based upon their average in other parts of the course.

Final grades will be assigned approximately on the basis of 90%-100% A, 80%-89% B, and so forth.




Schedule
This schedule will be projected to the end of the term soon.  If you click on the topic for a day you will see a handout for that day.  Note that the handout for 9/4 is this document; clicking on it will take you back to the top.
