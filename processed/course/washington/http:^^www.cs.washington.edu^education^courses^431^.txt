About file formats:
Most of the
course materials above are provided in three formats:





LaTeX:
Plain ASCII text including formating commands.
Simple things (e.g. assignments) are generally quite legible in
this format.  For figures and complex math stuff, these are
hard-to-impossible to read.
Adobe Acrobat
:
The latest & greatest.
Get a free viewer from Adobe's
Acrobat and the Web
Page.

PostScript:
The
Ghostscript Home Page
has free viewers (Mac, Windows, OS/2, Linux, ...)
At this time, Acrobat is supported on fewer systems, but is
preferable if you can use it -- files are smaller, rendering is
faster and more legible, and it can print (which Mac Ghostscript
can't, for example).
