Converting raw text to Postscript
Some people have asked how to convert raw text to Postscript.  The
simple way is to use the Unix program enscript.  Here are two suggested
ways of doing this:
enscript -2r -G -pfile.ps file.txt
enscript -G -pfile.ps file.txt
The first prints the files 2-up (good for source code).  The second
prints them 1-up.  The -G gives a nice header.  This generate a
Postscript file file.ps.  If you leave out the "-pfile.ps", it
should
just send the file to the printer.

More to come!
