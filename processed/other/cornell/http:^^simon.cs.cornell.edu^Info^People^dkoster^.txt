Hi!  I'm now a Masters of Engineering student in the
Computer Science Department here at Cornell.  I graduated last
year and majored in Economics, Mathematics, and Computer
Science.  I currently work for Professor
Brian Smith
and T.A. that wonderful
course,
CS99
.  And I'm one of the thousands of Oklahomans secretly populating
and subverting the Northeast (at last count, I believe there are 20 or so
students from the Mother Land here at Cornell).  If you want to start
some trouble or just chuck a few comments at me,
shoot
.
