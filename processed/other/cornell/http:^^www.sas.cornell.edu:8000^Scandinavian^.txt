The Cornell University Scandinavian Club






The Cornell Scandinavian Club

The Scandinavian Club is an informal group of Scandinavians and other
Cornelians interested in Scandinavian culture and languages. We get
together to discuss common interests, to enjoy ourselves and to organize
social and cultural events to promote Scandinavian culture and languages in the Cornell community.
