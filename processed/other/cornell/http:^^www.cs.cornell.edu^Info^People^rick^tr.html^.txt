IMACS-94 --
Physical Elements:
Using chains and cell complexes to solve multiple domain PDE problems
A brief description of how
has been used to
encode a Lax-Wendroff approximation to the 1D Euler Equations of fluid
flow.
TR94-1406 --
Chain Models
and Finite Element Analysis
Shows how
is a "programming
language for FEM," by developing a three page executable encoding of a
finite element approximation to plane stress using quadratic shape
functions defined over triangles.
TR93-1375 --
Chain Models of
Physical Behavior for Engineering Analysis and Design
Suggests
that because computers have a preeminent role in engineering analysis
today,
computation
needs to be explicitly addressed in
mathematical models of engineering systems, and proposes a methodology
for doing this based on algebraic topological concepts.
TR92-1246 --
SimLab:
Automatically Creating Physical Systems Simulators
Describes a computer environment for creation lumped model simulators
from high level specifications.
ASME-WAM92 --
1992 ASME Winter Annual Meeting SimLab Paper
A later version of TR92-1246 that includes examples from electrical
circuits, rigid body dynamics, etc.
