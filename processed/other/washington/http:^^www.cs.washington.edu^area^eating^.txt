Introduction
Seattle is a good city for restaurants.  There are notable restaurants
in all price ranges and for most major cuisines.  Seafood is a very
good bet.  A number of restaurants have sprung up that serve what
could be called "Northwest Cuisine," specializing in fresh local
ingredients.  European restaurants are well represented, with Italian
being particularly strong.  There are a large number of Thai
restaurants which are consistently good, and a smattering of
Vietnamese restaurants.  There are a number of good Japanese
restaurants.  In addition to being a good place to eat, Seattle is
also a good place to drink: there are several microbreweries that make
very good beers, and Northwest wines are gaining increasing
recognition.
Many of the restaurants are within walking distance from Downtown
hotels (especially the Downtown, Pike Place Market, and some of
the Capitol Hill restaurants).   The restaurants listed for Pioneer Square,
the International District, Seattle Center, and the eastern reaches of
Captiol Hill are further away but still within walking distance;
you can also, of course, take the bus (the new downtown bus tunnel
is worth a visit in any case) or a cab.  Bus access to the University
district is particularly easy.
Street addresses in Seattle are potentially confusing.  Seattle is
divided into a number of regions, and the streets are designated with
the appropriate compass points.  In downtown the compass point is
empty.  The compass points are significant, since 1st Ave N is
different from 1st Ave NE is different from 1st Ave NW is different
from 1st Ave.  Streets generally run east-west and Avenues generally
run north-south (although in some areas, such as downtown, east-west
and north-south are used in a weak sense).  Both streets and avenues
are numbered, so after a series of wrong turns, you could find
yourself at the corner of 45th and 45th (in fact there are several
different places in the city where you could find yourself at this
intersection).  The compass point comes
before
an
(east-west-running) street name, as in N 50th Street,
and
after
a (north-south-running) avenue name, as in 9th Avenue
NE.  This makes the use of "street" and "avenue" redundant, so they
are often omitted.
The restaurants below are open seven days a week unless otherwise
noted, but call to be safe.  Restaurants are classified as
inexpensive, inexpensive-moderate, moderate, moderate-expensive, and
expensive.  A listing of restaurants by type of food follows the main
listing.
None of these restaurants will disappoint.  We have marked with an
asterisk (
*
) restaurants particularly recommended for the
infrequent visitor to Seattle.  We should note that these selections
and the accompanying comments are the personal opinions of various
members of the Department.



Restaurants By Location




Downtown




Dahlia Lounge *
, 1904 Fourth Avenue, 682-4142
Moderate-expensive. Tom Douglas has been a pioneer in Northwest cuisine, and
the food and decor here is eclectic.

Fullers *
, Seattle Sheraton Hotel, Sixth Avenue and Pike,
447-5544
Expensive.  Consistently one of the highest rated restaurants in
the city.  Atmosphere and service are quite formal, at least by Seattle
standards.

McCormick's Fish House
, 722 Fourth Avenue, 682-3900
Moderate-Expensive.  Very wide range of fresh seafood.  A bit noisy.

Metropolitan Grill
, 820 Second Avenue, 624-3287
Moderate-Expensive.  A well-regarded steakhouse.  We don't
much like steaks, but you might.

Nikko *
, Fifth and Stewart (Westin Hotel), 322-4905
Moderate-Expensive.  Historically the best sushi in Seattle.
Recently transplanted from the International District.

The Painted Table
, Alexis Hotel, Madison at First Avenue
624-3626
Moderate-expensive.  Interesting, well-prepared American/Northwest
food in a very  pretty setting.   A good choice for a "typical Seattle" top
restaurant.





Pike Place Market




Campagne
, 86 Pine, 728-2800
Expensive.  Very good French country restaurant.

Cafe Campagne

A less formal, less expensive version of Campagne (above).

Chez Shea *
, Pike Place Market, 467-9990
Expensive.   Tiny restaurant serving Northwest cuisine upstairs
in the Market Building itself. Closed Sunday and Monday.

Etta's Seafood
, Western near north end of the Market, 443-6000
The new incarnation of Cafe Sport, a less expensive, less formal,
but still eclectic version of the Dahlia Lounge also conceived and managed
by Tom Douglas.  Early reports (and crowds) are extremely positive.

The Pink Door
, 1919 Post Alley, 443-3241
Moderate.  Cheap wine and decent interesting pasta dishes.
Fun, casual atmosphere, particularly when the outdoor deck is usable.

Place Pigalle
, Pike Place Market, 624-1756
Moderate.  Inside the market, great views, good fresh seafood.

El Puerco Lloron
, 1501 Western Avenue (Pike Place Hillclimb)
Inexpensive.  Authentic Mexican food.
Really sort of a cafeteria and take-out joint; worth a stop if you're
there and hungry.





Adjacent to the Market (North and South)




Casa-U-Betcha
, 2212 1st Ave, 441-1026
Inexpensive-Moderate.  A taco bar for beautiful yuppies.  Kind of fun.

Labuznik *
, 1924 1st Avenue, 682-1624
Expensive.  Consistently
one of Seattle's best restaurants.  Imaginative preparation of meat dishes.
Rack of lamb (for two) is superb.  Less expensive cafe menu served in
bar area up front. Closed Sunday and Monday.

Lamperia
, 2400 1st Avenue, 443-3301
Expensive.  Exquisitely prepared food, Continental / Northwest.
Some find it too formal, others rave.   Serious food, in any case.

Wild Ginger *
, 1400 Western, 623-4450
Moderate-Expensive.  Westernized Asian.  Pleasant, stylish decor.





Pioneer Square

Heading south along 1st Avenue leads past Pioneer Square at Yesler to
a number of renovated turn-of-the-century office buildings with many
art galleries and bars/cafes.


Al Boccalino *
, 1 Yesler Way, 622-7688
Moderate-expensive. Reservations sometimes difficult.
Definitely the best Italian food in town,
with an un-stuffy atmosphere.  Noisy. Closed Sundays.

Il Terrazzo Carmine
, 411 1st Avenue S, 467-7797
Expensive.  Classic Italian cuisine.  Very good food
in formal atmosphere.  Closed Sunday.

Trattoria Mitchelli
, 84 Yesler Way, 623-3883
Moderate.  Open nearly all the
time.  It's only OK Italian food, but at 3 a.m. who cares?
The bar has decent pizza and calzone.

Viet My
, 129 Prefontaine Place S, 382-9923
Inexpensive. Hole in the wall place with good Vietnamese food.





International District

An area east of the Kingdome surrounding Uwajimaya, the superb Asian
supermarket.


Green Village
, 721 S King, 624-3634
Moderate.  Peking/Szechuan.  Also, one of the few places in
Seattle serving real Taiwanese food.  Closed Sunday-Tuesday.

Ho Ho Seafood Restaurant
, 651 S Weller, 382-9671
Moderate-Expensive.  Not great decor, but really good food.

House of Hong
, 409 8th Ave S, 622-7997
Inexpensive. Good Cantonese, but dim sum is the really strong suit here.

Little Bit of Saigon
, 1036-A S Jackson St, 325-3663
Inexpensive.  Good Vietnamese (predominantly Northern).

Mikado *
, 514 S Jackson Street, 622-5206
Expensive.  One of the best Japanese restaurants on the west cost.
Closed Sunday.

Ocean City Restaurant
, 609 S Weller, 623-2333
Good for dim sum.

Thanh Vi
, 1046 S Jackson, 329-0208
Inexpensive.  Vietnamese (Southern).





Capitol Hill




Angel's Thai Cuisine *
, 235 Broadway E, 328-0515
Moderate.  Has a very strong local following.

Aoki
, 621 Broadway E, 324-3633
Moderate.  Highly recommended sushi. Closed Monday.

Ayutthaya Thai Restaurant
, 727 E Pike St, 324-8833
Inexpensive. Very good Thai food.  Closed Sunday.

Cafe Sabika
, 315 E. Pine (at Melrose), 622-3272
French/Italian/eclectic food, all very interesting.  A small,
very friendly,  informal room, where you will get to meet the
owner (and he may well sing opera for you if things are slow).
Always a very pleasant evening.

Siam on Broadway
, 616 Broadway E, 324-0892
Moderate.  Among the best Thai in Seattle.





Seattle Center




Kaspar's
, 19 W Harrison, 298-0123
Moderate.   Creative use of local ingredients in European presentation.
Some very interesting food, in a fairly staid setting.

Thai Restaurant
, 101 John St at 1st Ave, 285-9000
Very good Thai food.  Inexpensive-Moderate. Closed Monday.





Lake Union

These restaurants are located on both sides of Lake Union.


Adriatica
, 1107 Dexter Avenue N, 285-5000
(West side of Lake Union.)  Expensive.
Excellent Italian and Yugoslavian food.  But perhaps the best
feature is the dark, quiet bar up on the third floor overlooking
Lake Union.

Chandler's Crab House
, 901 Fairview Ave N, 223-2722
(South end of Lake Union.)  Moderate-Expensive.
Fresh seafood with a nice view over Lake Union.
Terrific on a sunny day.

I Love Sushi
, 1001 Fairview Ave N, 625-9604
Despite the silly name, good sushi at reasonable prices.

Rattlers Grill *
, 1823 Eastlake Ave E, 325-7350
(East side of Lake Union.)  Moderate.
A good, fun, Southwestern ("New Mexican") restaurant.





University District

Probably the best way to choose a restaurant in the
University District is to go to The Ave (University
Way) and walk until you see something that tempts you.


Big Time Brewing Company
, 4133 University Way NE
Brew pub with decent sandwich-style food.

Toscana
, 1312 NE 43rd St, 547-7679 (in the alley), Moderate,
Italian.  The most formal (and most expensive) restaurant in the
general area.   Nice Italian food if you are interested in
a "bigger occasion" sort of place.

Wanza
, 6409 Roosevelt Ave NE, 525-3950
Inexpensive.  Ethiopian.  Closed Monday.





North of the University District

No reservations, often crowded.

Sante Fe Cafe
, 2255 NE 65th Street 524-7736, and 5910 Phinney
Avenue N, 783-9733
Moderate.  New Mexican food, very good, green chili burritos a specialty.
Northwest Beers.  Closed Sunday and Monday.





North Capitol Hill / Montlake / Madison Park




Cactus *
, 4220 E Madison, 324-4140
Moderate.  Excellent Spanish / (New) Mexican.

Cafe Flora *
, 2901 E Madison, 325-9100
Moderate.  Vegetarian cooking raised to new heights.
Very pleasant decor.   Can be crowded.

Cafe Lago
, 2305 24th Ave E, 329-8005
Moderate.  More good Italian food.  Close to the University
(across Montlake Bridge).  Small, friendly, informal room.  No reservations,
but you can wait in the tavern next door.

Rovers *
, 2808 E Madison, 325-7442
Expensive.  Outstanding, semi-formal, French-inspired Northwest
cuisine.  Small portions.

Sostanza
, 1927 43rd E, 324-9701
Moderate.
Pleasant Italian restaurant with interesting food.
Along the lines of Al Boccalino and Il Terrazzo Carmine
but a little cheaper (and less formal than Carmine).





Ballard / Fremont / Phinney Ridge




Chinook's at Salmon Bay
, Fishermen's Terminal,
Ballard, 283-HOOK
Inexpensive-Moderate.  Good fresh fish and chowders.
Can be noisy.

Le Gourmand *
, 425 NW Market St, 784-3463
Expensive.  Intimate, no-frills decor with some of the best
Northwest cuisine in town.  A must for the serious foodie.
Closed Sunday-Tuesday.

Ponti Seafood Grill
, 3014 3rd Ave N, 284-3000
Moderate-expensive.  Just south of Fremont bridge,
with nice view of the boats.  Excellent NW/seafood.

Ray's Boathouse *
, 6049 Seaview NW, Expensive, 789-3770
Seafood with a great view.  Reservations are difficult.
The upstairs portion of the restaurant
(Ray's Cafe) does not
take reservations, has much of the main menu, has a more relaxed
atmosphere, and is much cheaper.  Go there; definitely worth the trip
on a nice evening.





Elsewhere




Bai Tong
, 15859 Pacific Highway S,
SeaTac (by the airport!), 431-0893
The best Thai food in the area.

Pirsomani
