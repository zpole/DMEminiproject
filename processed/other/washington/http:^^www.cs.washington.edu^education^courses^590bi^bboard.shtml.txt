Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu>

1. We have created a mail distribution list cse590bi@cs.washington.edu from
the electronic addresses you supplied in the first week.  This can be used
for announcements, discussion outside of class, etc.

2. As Dick mentioned, we very much want to encourage you to sign up for credit
if at all possible.  To accomodate this, we have changed to variable credit
(anywhere between 1 and 3), with the following scheme:

a. 1 credit for attending faithfully and serving as notetaker when it is your
turn,

b. 1 credit for homework plus the take-home final, if there is one,

c. 1-2 credits for the project, depending on its magnitude,

up to a maximum of 3 credits.  Please choose your level of involvement and
sign up for the appropriate number of credits.  Monday is the last day to make
such changes without penalty, I believe.  Signing up for credits is good for
the department and, if you're anything like me when it comes to good
intentions, good for the student as well.

If you have questions about the credits or would like to discuss your plan for
the course, feel free to talk with any of us.  If (or when) you are
signed up for credit, please also send mail to Tompa saying how you intend to
satisfy the number of credits you chose, so that we know who are the
notetakers, who is doing a project, etc.

Subject: Algorithms notes

Martin,
I just wanted to alert the class to a couple of topical books.

1) Calculating the Secrets of Life
Lander and Waterman, eds.
1995
National academy Press

This has several good chapters, including one on yesterday and
tomorrow's lectures by Gene Myers.  At the end of this chapter, Gene
states that the lowest bound on comparing two sequences yet found is
O(NlogN), which addresses a question raised at the end of class
yesterday.  He claims that the fastest algorithm to date is O(N^2/log^2N)
(Masek and Paterson, 1980), leaving a gap between the fastest algorithm
and the highest lowest theoretical bound for algorithms, and thus an
open problem.
Other good chapters include one on statistical significance of
comparisons by Waterman, probabilistic gene mapping by Lander, and
molecular clock rates by Tavare.  The book also includes four chapters on
conformational computation.
The UW library's copy is checked out by me and currently has a
hold on it by someone else.  The bookstore should have one or more copies.

2) Introduction to Computational Biology
Waterman
1995
Chapman and Hall

This book just came out.  I ordered my copy through the bookstore
and it took many weeks for it to arrive.  I haven't had a chance to read
it yet, but it covers many of the above areas.  It is about 50% on mapping,
30% on sequence alignment and assembly, and has a chapter on RNA
secondary structure and one on tree assembly.
It has a 50 page chapter on the dynamic programming of yesterday
and tomorrow's lectures.

My instructions led you down a slightly wrong path on problem 3.  You should
assume that n is a power of 2, rather than one more than a power of 2, for
simplicity.  A small bonus is that it means you can ignore all the ceiling
notation in the problem.  A big bonus is that it means you won't have the same
misconception about how the algorithm works that I had until a few minutes ago.

Sorry for misleading you.

> Sequence comparison in computational molecular biology is a powerful tool
> for deriving evolutionary or functional relationships between genes.
> However, classical alignment algorithms handle only local mutations (i.e.
> insertions, deletions and substitutions of one nucleotide) and ignore
> global rearrangements (i.e.  inversions and transpositions of long

> mitochondrial DNA) are very limited. I address the problem of  GENOME
> comparison versus classical GENE comparison and present algorithms to
> analyse rearrangements in genomes evolving by inversions, transpositions
> and translocations. In the simplest form the problem corresponds to
> sorting by reversals,  i.e.  sorting of an array using reversals  of
> arbitrary fragments. I present polynomial algorithms and duality theorems
> for sorting by reversals and genomic distance problem. I also discuss
> applications of the  proposed techniques to analyze evolution of herpes
> viruses, plant mitochondrial DNA and mammalian chromosomes.

some course project suggestions
Date: Fri, 09 Feb 1996 10:44:24 PST
From:
Martin Tompa <tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu>

Here are a few project ideas for CSE 590BI, to get you thinking about them.
If you are doing a project and have your own ideas about what you would like
to do, please come talk with us about them.

If anyone else on this mailing list has interesting suggestions for course
projects, please send them to us.

CLASSIFICATION OF PROSTATE CANCER TUMORS

This project is related to research in  Lee Hood's laboratory on the
classification of prostate cancer tumors. It is believed that a disease
category such as prostate cancer or ovarian cancer includes a number of
distinct disease types that may require very different kinds of medical
treatment. Some prostate cancers develop so slowly that they present no
threat to mortality, while others require immediate medical intervention.
The existing diagnostic tests do not distinguish the different variants of
the disease. Molecular biology may provide new experimental techniques that
will distinguish the different types of prostate cancer or ovarian cancer. It
is now possible to extract the mRNA from a tumor and transcribe it back to
cDNA. By hybridizing the mix of cDNAs from a tumor against a large number of
genes from normal tissue and measuring the amounts of hybridization product
produced, one obtains a profile of the gene expression taking place in the
tumor. Experiments are now getting under way which will use this hybridization
technique to obtain 25,000 measurements of gene expression in each of
600 prostate cancer tumors, and data will be available by late March. These
experiments will provide much more detailed "fingerprints" of tumors than has
been available up to now.

The computational challenge is to use this large body of data to classify the
tumors into clusters and, based on this classification, to determine rules
that can be used to classify tumors in the future. One special feature
of the problem is the high dimensionality of the data; i.e., the large number
of measurements for each tumor. It is likely that only a small subset of these
measurements will be important for the clasification, but we cannot know in
advance which ones these will be.  The project will consist of looking
into the literature of clustering and classification to discover appropriate
computational methods and software packages, as well as devising special
methods suited to this particular problem. Since real data will not be
available by the end of the quarter, it may be desirable to test out different
methods on simulated data.

MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT

There are a few different ideas for projects concerned with multiple
sequence alignment, as introduced in Lecture 6 and Homework 1.  The
general issues to explore are the various methods of valuation of
alignments (sum-of-pairs, consensus, Steiner, phylogenetic tree), and
efficient algorithms for achieving good alignments under any of these
valuation schemes.

Because no one knows efficient algorithms for optimal alignments under
any of these valuation schemes, the project could explore ideas for
heuristics or approximation algorithms.  Dick Karp has a divide and
conquer heuristic that he would be interested in sharing.  There is a
minimum spanning tree heuristic hinted at in problem 10 of Homework 1,
and more details of what is done in practice are available in
Gusfield's manuscript and other sources.

Exploring such heuristics could be done experimentally, or
analytically.  Data for experimentation might come from exisiting
databases containing multiple aligned sequences, or could be generated
synthetically.

cDNA MATCHING

Another project to explore is introduced in problem 4 of Homework 1:
For the cDNA matching problem, experiment with realistic gap penalties
reflecting what is known about intron lengths.

NEW COURSE

Spring Quarter, 1996
under the Topics in Genetics number (GENET 554)

Joe Felsenstein

of the Department of Genetics
will teach a 3-credit course in

Phylogenetic Inference

at 11:30-12:20 MWF in room J280 Health Sciences Building

This course will cover, at the graduate level, the biology, statistics, and
computation of estimating phylogenies (evolutionary trees), inferring how much
uncertainty we have about the estimates, and making use of phylogenies in other
kinds of inferences.

Prerequisite is enough background in biology to know what DNA is, enough
statistics to know what likelihood is, and enough mathematics to be able to
understand what a matrix is.

Topics covered will include:

What is a phylogeny?        restriction sites and RAPDs
Parsimony methods           gene frequencies
Compatibility methods       morphology and quantitative characters
Distance matrix methods     comparative methods
Likelihood methods          coalescent trees of genes
Searching tree space        consensus trees and tree distances
nucleotide sequences        tests based on tree shape
proteins

There will also be computer exercises.

We are planning to run a somewhat more informal continuation of CSE
590BI (Computation, Molecular Biology, etc.)  during Spring quarter.
We hope to revisit in more depth some topics introduced last quarter
(e.g. perhaps sequence assembly, MCD mapping), as well as explore
some new ones (perhaps protein folding, biomolecular computing,
genome rearrangement).  The topic list is not finalized; feel free
to send suggestions if you have particular interests.

Time:    Thursdays, 12:00-1:30 (starting next week, 3/28)
Note it's just one day per week.
Place:   MEB 238
Grading: Credit/No Credit
Units:   Variable (1-3).  1 unit will again entail light housework,
at worst.  2 or 3 units for more substantive involvement,
e.g., reading and presenting paper(s); negotiable.
(I don't have the SLN yet; it should appear in the official
time schedule tomorrow.)

We suspect that many people who would be interested in the

Unfortunately there's a time conflict, and rescheduling our class is

weeks, so what we've decided to do is delay starting ours until
*** Thursday, April 25 ***, continuing on the 5 subsequent
Thursday's.  This should avoid the conflicts.  So, until 4/25,
you're encouraged to go to Baker's seminar if interested, and to
join us for CSE590bi in MEB 238, 12:00-1:20 Thursdays, starting
4/25.  We'll work  out and distribute a schedule of topics in
advance of that.

Please contact Karp, Tompa, or me if you have questions about
registration, credits, or other administrative or substantive
issues.

Here's a repeat of Baker's announcement.  Note the room has been
changed to K-450, not J-something as reported below.

Martin,

I wanted to let you know about a conference I'm organizing
which will take place the week before FCRC. We'd very much like
to have people involved in training in computational biology
at the conference, so especially would like to have people from
Washington (your department and Biotechnology as well).  Would
you please distribute this to anyone who might be interested?

Thanks very much,

Tandy

course on Genome Sequence Analysis

As most of you already know from the message I sent out earlier, I will be
offering a course on Genome Sequence Analysis this Fall (rough outline
below). Based on the initial response, it looks as though the best meeting
times would be Tu-Th 12:00 - 1:20. Please let me know if you are
interested in the course but would be unable to attend at that time
(unfortunately though there aren't many alternative times that wouldn't
cause problems for somebody).
I'll be sending out an announcement later with the official course number
and additional details.

Phil




Genome Sequence Analysis: Outline

(The course is intended to be reasonably self-contained in the
sense that relatively little biological or computational background will
be assumed. There will be some overlap with the course CSE 590BI offered
last winter, but I will be covering a more limited number of topics, in
substantially greater depth. In particular there will be much heavier
emphasis on the relevant biology, on statistical issues, and on pragmatic
issues (e.g. use of current computer programs).)

I. Biological background: basic concepts of molecular biology;
genes and genomes; sequence evolution.

II. Sequence interpretation.
a. Finding protein and DNA sequence similarities.  Pairwise sequence
comparison algorithms:  Smith-Waterman, BLAST, FASTA.  Statistics of
sequence comparison and database searches: likelihood ratios,
Karlin-Altschul theory, empirical methods. Low-complexity sequences.
Optimal score matrices & gap penalties.  Profiles, "motifs". Multiple
comparison methods: Gibbs sampler, Hidden Markov Models.
b. Finding genes. Detection of coding regions, codon biases.
Detection of splice sites, weight matrices.
c. Finding repeats.
d. Finding regulatory sites and other subtle sequence features.

III. Sequence assembly. Shotgun sequencing strategies; assembly
algorithms;  assessment of data quality; statistics of sequence accuracy.

Phil,

I have set up your Special Topics Class (Sequence Analysis) for AU 1996.
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:00-1:20 in HSB T-473. The capacity for the
room is 50 people.

599 is MBT's general special topics course. Since 599A is Research Methods
and 599B is Research Discussions your course will fall under the 599C
section.I have also requested entry codes and a schedule line number as we
do with the other 599 sections.

Let me know if there is anything else!
