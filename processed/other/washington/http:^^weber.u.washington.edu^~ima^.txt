The Recreational Sports Programs staff invites you to enjoy the exercise, sports and fitness opportunities available to students, faculty and staff members at the University of Washington.
The benefits of regular exercise are well documented and if you haven't visited the Intramural Activities Building (IMA), Waterfront Activities Center (WAC), or the Golf Driving Range, your invitation includes information about exercise programs, sports and fitness classes, sports competition and informal recreation.
A comprehensive program of sixty different sports activities has been designed with you in mind. Whatever your style, interests or skill level, introduce yourself to a recreational experience that is just minutes away.
