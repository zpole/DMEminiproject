Isis Mei Grant






This is currently the closest thing to a baby book that we've
assembled for Isis.  It is basically a log of her development -- notes
really.  One of these days, I will polish it up.
I've linked the pages together with forward and back arrows at the
bottom of each page.  So, you can click on
Prenatal
and follow the links all the way to
the most recent page.  Or, just click on the month you want to see.

Prenatal

The Birth

First Month

Second Month

Third Month

Fourth Month

Fifth Month

Sixth Month

Seventh Month

Eighth Month

Ninth Month


12/9/96:
I've done a massive update of Isis's web site over
the past two weeks, including new pictures in months two through eight.
Since I've broken up the page into smaller pieces, I'm no longer
maintaining the "Latest Activities" page.  Instead, I'll put summaries
at the end of every month or so.
