ZPL Program Walk-Through



ZPL Program Walk-Through


Though ZPL is a new, powerful array language, users of other
languages such as C, Fortran, Pascal,
etc
. find it quite
intuitive after a brief introduction.  Therefore, looking at a sample
program is, perhaps, the fastest introduction to ZPL.

The accompanying ZPL program solves the Jacobi computation:




Jacobi
: Given an array
A
,
iteratively replace its elements with the average of their four
nearest neighbors, until the largest change between two consecutive
iterations is less than
delta
.



For this example
A
will be a two dimensional
array, and the program will generate its own data:
A
is initialized to 0.0, except for its southern boundary, which is set
to the constant 1.0 in all positions.  The tolerance
delta
will be 0.0001.

5 config var n       : integer = 10;                -- Declarations
6            delta   : float   = 0.0001;

region     R       = [1..n, 1..n];

10
direction  north   = [-1, 0]; south = [ 1, 0];
11            east    = [ 0, 1]; west  = [ 0,-1];
12
13 procedure jacobi();                               -- Entry point
14
var A, Temp : [R] float;
15     err     :     float;
16
17              begin
18
[R]              A := 0.0;                        -- Initialization
19 [north of R]     A := 0.0;
20 [east  of R]     A := 0.0;
21 [west  of R]     A := 0.0;
22 [south of R]     A := 1.0;
23
24
[R]              repeat                           -- Main body
25                      Temp := (A@north+A@east+A@west+A@south) / 4.0;
26                      err  := max<< abs(A-Temp);
27                      A    := Temp;
28                  until err
<
delta;
29
30 [R]              writeln(A);                      -- Output result
31              end;

A quick skim of the Jacobi program shows that it is organized
pretty much like other programs



Declarations
(Lines 5-11)

Starting point for the executable part of the computation (Line 13)


Initialization
of the
A
array (Lines 18-22)


Iteration loop
to compute the result
(Lines 24-28)

Result output (Line 30).


The quick look also reveals that assignment is written
:=
rather than
=
as in C or Fortran,
and that every statement is terminated by a semicolon.  Comments
starting with
--
extend to the end of the line, while
/*
and
*/
are comment "brackets."

The main thing that is unconventional about ZPL is that it
computes with whole arrays rather than individual array elements.
Thus, Line 18

[R]      A := 0.0;

sets the entire array
A
to zero.  No indexing.  No
looping.  The
[R]
specifies the region of
A
to be assigned, which in this case is all of
A
.  Compare with similar computations expressed in
other languages that must manipulate individual elements:



Fortran 77

C

Pascal
DO 10 I = 1,N      for (i = 0;i
<
n;i++) {       FOR I:=1 TO N DO
DO 10 J = 1,N       for (j = 0;i
<
n;j++) {       FOR J:=1 TO N DO
10 A(I,J) = 0.0               a[i][j] = 0.0;                A[I,J] := 0.0;
}
}

Even Fortran 90, another array language, is more cumbersome
because of its required range specification:

A[1:N,1:N] = 0.0                     !FORTRAN 90.

Concepts like "regions," explained momentarily, simplify ZPL,
because the programmer can think more abstractly, and leave the low
level details like indexing and looping to the language.  As shown
below no performance is lost to have this convenience.

The Jacobi program is explained in the following.  It might
be convenient to

clone your window to keep a copy of the program
visible.

A more thorough introduction to ZPL can be found in the
ZPL
Programmer's Guide
.



Regions and Declarations


A fundamental concept in ZPL is the notion of a
region
.  A
region is simply a set of indices.  For example, (Line 8),
region R = [1..n, 1..n];
specifies the standard indices of an
n
x
n
array, i.e. the set of ordered pairs {(1,1), (1,2),
. . ., (
n
,
n
)}.  Regions can be used to
declare arrays, which means the array is defined for those indices.
Thus, (Line 14),
var   A, Temp : [R] float;
declares two
n
x
n
array variables,
A
and
Temp
, composed of floating point
numbers (called "real" in some languages) with indices given by region
R
.  The final variable declaration, (Line 15),
err: float;
does not mention a region, and so
err
is declared to
be a simple scalar variable.


The program next declares a set of four directions.  Directions
are used to transform regions, as in the expression
north of
R
(Line 19).  They are vectors with as many elements as the
region has dimensions.  The four direction declarations, (Lines
10-11),
direction  north   = [-1, 0]; south = [ 1, 0];
east    = [ 0, 1]; west  = [ 0,-1];
point unit distance in the four cardinal compass directions.  The
figures below illustrate transformations on region
R
using these directions.


Initializations


Regions also allow ZPL computations to be extended to operate on
entire arrays without explicit looping.  By prefixing a statement with
a region specifier, which is simply the region name in brackets, the
operations of the statement are applied to all elements in the array.
Thus, (Line 18),
[R]  A := 0.0;

assigns 0.0 to all n^2 elements of array
A
with
indices in
R
.

Since many scientific problems have boundary conditions, the
region specifier can be used to augment arrays with boundaries.
Extending the array
A
with boundaries and initializing
their values is the role of the next four lines, (Lines 19-22),

[north of R] A := 0.0;
[east  of R] A := 0.0;
[west  of R] A := 0.0;
[south of R] A := 1.0;

The region specifier
[
d
of R]
defines the index set of a region adjacent to
R
in the
d
direction; the statement is then applied to the elements of
the region.  Thus,
[north of R]
defines the index set
which is a "0th" row for
A
, and the assignment
A := 0.0
initializes these elements.  The successive
effects of these initialization statements are illustrated in Figure
2.

for A.



Program Body


With the declarations and initialization completed, programming
the Jacobi computation is simple.  The repeat-loop, which iterates
until the condition becomes true, has three statements:


Compute
a new approximation by averaging
all elements (Line 25).

Determine the
largest
amount of change
between this and the new iteration (Line 26).


Update

A
with the new
iteration (Line 27).


All statements are executed in the context of the
R
region, since the repeat statement is prefixed by
the
[R]
region specifier.  The statements operate as
follows.


Averaging
.  The averaging illustrates
how explicit array indexing is avoided in ZPL by referring to adjacent
array elements using the
@
operator.  The statement,
(Line 25),
Temp := (A@north+A@east+A@west+A@south)/4.0;
finds for each element in
A
the average of its four
nearest neighbors and assigns the result to
Temp
.  An
expression
A@
d
, executed in the context of a
region
R
, results in an array of the same size and
shape as
R
composed of elements of
A
offset in the direction
d
.  As illustrated in Figure 3,
A@
d
can be thought of as adding
d
to
each index, or equivalently in this case, shifting
A
.






Figure 3.  "At" references to
A
and its
boundaries executed in the context of a region specifier covering all
of
A
; the dots shown in
A
correspond
to element (1,1) in the shifted arrays.


The four arrays are combined elementwise, yielding the effect of
computing for element
(i,j)
the sum of its four nearest
neighbors.  This can be seen by the following identities:
(i,j)@north  =  (i, j) + north  =  (i, j) + (-1, 0)  =  (i-1, j  )
(i,j)@east   =  (i, j) + east   =  (i, j) + ( 0, 1)  =  (i  , j+1)
(i,j)@west   =  (i, j) + west   =  (i, j) + ( 0,-1)  =  (i  , j-1)
(i,j)@south  =  (i, j) + south  =  (i, j) + ( 1, 0)  =  (i+1, j  )
The elements are then each divided by 4.0 and the result is stored
into
Temp
.


Maximum Finding
.  To compute the largest
change of any element between the current and the next iteration,
(Line 26), more elementwise array operations are performed.  The bold
subexpression,
err := max<<
abs(A-Temp)
;
causes the elements of
Temp
to be subtracted from the
corresponding elements of
A
, and then the absolute value
of each element is found i.e.
abs(A[1,1]-Temp[1,1])
,
abs(A[1,2]-Temp[1,2])
,. . . ,
abs(A[n,n]-Temp[n,n])
.  This computes the magnitude of
change of all the elements.  To find the largest among these, a maximum
reduction (
max<<
) is performed.  This operation "reduces"
the entire array to its largest element.  This maximum is then assigned
to
err
, a scalar variable, that controls the loop.


Update
.  The final statement of the
loop, (Line 27),
A := Temp;
simply installs
Temp
as the current value of
A
.

Performance

Although the ZPL program is written at a high level that relieves
the programmer of many tedious details, it was not necessary to give
up performance for this convenience.  The Jacobi program has been
hand-coded in C and customized to two representative parallel
computers, the Intel Paragon and the Kendall Square Research KSR-2.
The results, shown in the accompanying graph, demonstrate that for
this problem at least, ZPL was just as efficient as a "low level"
programming solution.

(n=512) on the Kendall Square Research KSR-2, the Intel Paragon,
and a C program handcoded for each machine.



ZPL programs perform well because the higher level array concepts
are easier for a compiler to analyze and "understand."  This means
that the ZPL compiler is frequently successful at finding
opportunities to optimize the program.


Summary
.  The Jacobi program illustrates fundamental
properties of ZPL.  Computations are performed on whole arrays,
avoiding error prone indexing and tedious looping.  Global operations
like finding the maximum element of an array are provided as language
primitives.  In general
ZPL's high level array concepts simply the
programmer's task and allow the compiler to produce very efficient
code.

ZPL is therefore ideal for array-based scientific and engineering
computations that require high performance.
