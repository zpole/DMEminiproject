I am a third year
grad student
from
Hong Kong
,
working towards my doctoral degree in the
Computer Science Department
at
the
University of Washington
.
When I'm not at work, I
shoot
.
(My officemates also like to
shoot,
but in a different way
.)
Research Interests

I am working on validating large software system requirements specifications
using symbolic model checking.
This is joint work with a group of smart people:
Richard Anderson
,
Paul Beame
,
Steve Burns
,
Francesmary Modugno
,
David Notkin
,
and
Jon Reese
.
Recently we analyzed an early version of the
TCAS II
(Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System)
System Requirements Specification written in
the
Requirements State Machine Language
(RSML)
using a
BDD
based model checker, the
Symbolic Model Verifier
(SMV).
A
paper
appeared in
ACM SIGSOFT '96
(FSE 4).
I have continued interests in
systems
and
theory
.
When I was an undergrad at
Cornell
,
I worked with
Ken Birman
and
Robbert van Renesse
in the
Horus
project (a distributed system based on group communications).
