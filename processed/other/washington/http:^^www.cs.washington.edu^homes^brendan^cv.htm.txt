Curriculum Vitae



Brendan Marshall Mumey




I am currently a Ph.D. candidate
in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Washington.
I entered in the fall of 1992 and expect to graduate by the
fall of 1996. I am 28 years old.  I have dual US and Canadian
citizenship.

Research



My general interests run to applying
theoretical techniques to solve problems which have practical
motivation. My current work is in computational biology.  Specifically,
I have worked on the problem of comparing DNA clones based on
their "multiple complete digest" fingerprint. This fingerprint
is gathered by digesting each clone with several different restriction
enzymes and measuring (using gel electrophoresis) the lengths
into which each clone is divided. Using a stochastic model of
this process, I developed an estimator of the a posteriori probability
that two clones overlap given their measured fingerprints. An
overlap test based on this approach is provably powerful in the
sense of achieving nearly the lowest rate of false negatives for
a given rate of false positives. Using this overlap test, I have
implemented a clone ordering algorithm which is crucial to finishing
the map.



More recently, I have been working
on a clustering problem which arises in the context of classifying
prostate cancer cells. The raw data consists of quantized hybridization
levels for several hundred cell lines against perhaps 25,000 cDNA
oligos. The problem is to discover the important features which
determine the general type and lethality of a particular cell
line.  This is joint with work with Dick Karp and Leroy Hood's
lab in the molecular biotechnology department at the University
of Washington.



I have also done some work in computational
astrophysics; my contribution being a new parallel algorithm and
implementation for detecting clusters in points sets. With Maria
Klawe I developed new upper and lower bounds for computing the
optimal alphabetic tree data structure.
