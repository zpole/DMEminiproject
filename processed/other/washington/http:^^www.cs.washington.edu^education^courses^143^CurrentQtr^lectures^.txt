On the
lab machines
Acrobat Reader is automatically
started up by Netscape when you follow the link.

On other Macs, PC compatibles, and some versions of
Unix
Acrobat Reader may be downloaded free directly from
Adobe
.  This web
site also includes instructions for setting your web browser to invoke
Acrobat Reader automatically.  Some versions of
Ghostscript
also
support Acrobat.


Extra Lecture Material
I've produced a revised, tested implementation of the two-way-list ADT using
doubly-linked lists as the implementation, correcting the
implementation slides from Friday 10/25:



twlist.h


twlist.cp


main.cp
(a test suite)

I've also produced a template version of this interface and
implementation, which can be instantiated with any type of element
automatically:



twlist-template.h


twlist-template.cp


main-template.cp
(a test suite)

These template versions work under Symantec C++ on the Mac, and I
think they'll compile correctly on other C++ systems that support
templates, but let me know if you find problems.
