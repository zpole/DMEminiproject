CSE 143 Quizzes
We administer weekly quizzes in section, typically on Thursdays where
there is no other exam.  Your overall course grade is only slightly
directly affected by your quiz performance.  It is our experience that
people who consistently do well on quizzes also do well on exams
(training and practice sets really do work).  We will post quizzes and
sample solutions on this page.
