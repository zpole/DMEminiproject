Ken McCann
is proud to announce the second year of the
Northwest Center for Environmental Education
, a nonprofit organization located at the beautiful Madrona Center on
San Juan Island
. Students of all ages are invited to participate in adventures and activities designed to enrich, enlighten, and educate.


Activities will include:

Kayaking



Ethnobotany



Shoreline habitat exploration


Bird watching



Astronomy



Fun, music and games

Guest speakers



The Madrona Center is superbly adapted for our needs and we feel extremely fortunate that owner Jayne Atkinson is so much in tune with our goals and purpose. Many of you will remember Jayne as the actress who played the part of the boy's mother in the movie Free Willy. Facilities include a large bunkhouse, geodesic dome, and a full kitchen.


Each week will include wildlife cruises around the islands, a visit to the Whale Museum, Wolf Hollow Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, and Westcott Bay Oyster Farm. Extra curricular activities will include musical entertainment in the dome, special guest speakers, and games.
