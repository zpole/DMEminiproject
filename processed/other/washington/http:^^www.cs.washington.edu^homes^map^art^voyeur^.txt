voyeur



voyeur
. a mail piece created for a
correspondent, a series of images and a story. look down the
tube, pull the cards out, push them back in, turn the thing
around, read the story...



voyeur.


i had a dream
i used to watch her. she never noticed me.
i couldn't help myself.
then one day..
i existed.
i couldn't get my fill.
but i bored her and her attention departed from me.
everything was bland.
i didn't want to look any more.
