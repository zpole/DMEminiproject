Shuichi's Links Page



Links to the WEB

I'm kinda infamous for liking to go out onto the Web in search of
'cool things.'  In fact, though I web-browse less than most people, I
do find lots of really interesting things from my travails, and here
are some of them.  This is by no means complete, as I've got a hotlist
that's close to 400 links long!  I'm currently trying to pick out
which ones deserve to stick around, and here are a few of my more
favorite sites that I have gone through so far.  You may note that
there is some duplication; that's because some sites may belong to
more than one category.  I also decided to bias the list here slightly
toward places that can serve documents quickly relative to the
University of Virginia.  I hope that you find this useful in your
travels on the WEB.

If you have any comments, suggestions, etc., please
mail me
at
SKoga@CS.Washington.EDU.  Thanks!

You can also examine my
current
netscape links

Countries and travel

This may require a little explanation.  If I find a link that has info
about a particular country, such as on culture, history, travel info,
etc., it's fairly coherent, and it's very good, then I may put it
here.  Note that many of these links sound like advertisements; that's
because, in fact, many of these
ARE
, so take the info with a
grain (or lump) of salt.
