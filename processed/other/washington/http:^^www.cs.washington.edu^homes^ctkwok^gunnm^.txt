Hyper Future Vision: Gunnm







"As to what life really is...
you have to experience it yourself...!"











Welcome!


GUNNM (aka
Battle Angel Alita
)
is a story about the life and works of a cyborg
girl Gally.


In the future, land-dwellers eke out a living from the garbage discarded
by a giant floating city Salem. Ido Daisuke finds a girl's
intact head amongst the flotsam, christening her Gally. Gally embarks on a
long, sad and bloody journey of life, trying to uncover
the mystery of her origins,  and above all,  finding the
meaning of her life.
