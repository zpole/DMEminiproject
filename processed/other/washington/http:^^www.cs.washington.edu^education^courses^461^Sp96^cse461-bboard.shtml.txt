Student Sean Vaughan has discovered that a particular
flavor of the internet phone uses both TCP and UDP.

Please read below.

Richard

-------------------------------

From Sean Vaughan:

In some of the the documentation that I was reading through on the
"internet phone" (http://www.vocaltec.com) I found the following:

... the two channels it works with:

1. TCP Port 6667 (decimal) to remote system: The port used to connect to
IRC (note that some IRC servers use different port assignments, such as
6665 or 6666, but none of them appear on the default list of IRC servers
in the Internet Phone. You need to open these ports only if you are
actually using servers on them).

2. UDP port 22555 (decimal). All audio is passed through this port on both
local and remote machine.

EOM

Basically TCP port 6667 is used for setting up the call while UDP port
22555 is used for the audio transmission.

Lecture clarification
Date: Wed, 17 Apr 1996 09:35:37 PDT
From:
Richard Ladner <ladner@whalespout.cs.washington.edu>

For all the sliding window policies the receiver
must send a request with sequence no i whenever it
receives a frame and i the number of the first
empty slot in its window after the frame arrives.

In this way the sender will eventually be notified
to send this frame again.

Thus line on transparency 9 is really correct
except it should read

-If window is at i and a frame j arrives
with j different from i then ignor the frame, but
send ack (request) with seq_no i.

My apologies for the confusion in class.

project 1

1  There are two fields for sequence numbers in the frame struct,
namely seq and ack. seq is for the sequence number of the data,
while ack is for the sequence number of the ack. The receiver
should not put sequence number in the seq field; it would be
wiped out by the simulator. Use the ack field instead.

2  If you use printf() to print debug information in sender() or
receiver(), the output might be mixed up and hard to read.
To partially fix this, copy the new protocol.h to your directory,
and instead of printf("mumble"), use fprintf(tty[id],"mumble").

3  Because of the size of the class, I won't have time to read your
code in any detail. So I'll mostly grade your code based on
correctness.  If your program doesn't work, make sure you explain
what the problem is, and what you think might cause the problem, etc,
so that I can give you partial credit.

After finishing Chapter 3 in the lecture Wednesday,
there will be a question and answer session.

Please be prepared with your questions and I can
hopefully help with answers.

As encouragement for you to ask questions, it is
often the case that students think their questions
are too simple or stupid.  This is almost never the
case.  If you don't understand something, even
something very basic, you can bet other students
don't either.  Your questions are most often
appreciated by other students.

Please come in with your questions on Wednesday.

Question and Answer Session
Date: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 16:59:39 PDT
From:
Richard Ladner <ladner@whalespout.cs.washington.edu>

Several students have e-mailed me questions for
Wednesday's session.  This is wonderful.  It gives
me a chance to think about the questions so I can
make thoughtful answers.

If you have any questions you can tell me ahead of
time just e-mail and I can hopefully answer on
Wednesday.

Here are the questions so far:

1. What, exactly, *is* bandwidth?
I thought bandwidth was the range of frequencies (in Hz) that a given
filter would pass.  In this case, a communication channel wire, or
fiber, or radio, etc.

However, in the homeowrks, bandwidth is used to refer to data rate, and
is given in bps.

I've seen this problem from outside sources before, as well, so is
"bandwidth" just a well-defined, but sometimes sloppily applied term?

2. I have some doubts, reg PAR and ABP.
You said we can fix PAR by putting seq_no into
acks, isn't that what the ABP does, or is there
any other difference ?

3.  What is the difference between ABP and
protocol no. 4?

All good questions, let's have more.

Also, the mean on the midterm was 64 with a high

problem solving over memory work.  In preparation for

Bad Calculation
Date: Fri, 03 May 1996 11:37:29 PDT
From:
Richard Ladner <ladner@whalespout.cs.washington.edu>

The calculation I did in class calculating the number
of bits on a 1km wire running at 10 Mbps was wrong.

What I wrote was
5 x 10^-6 sec x 10^7 b/sec = 500.

The correct calculation is
5 x 10^-6 sec x 10^7 b/sec = 5 x 10^1 = 50.

Thus, two frames cannot "pass in the night".  Needless
to say jamming is done probably because it is safer
and scales up to longer wires and higher bandwidths.

That'll teach me to try doing a calculation in real
time.

Please, please stop me during class
when you see me make such errors.

Except for protocol 6, when there is a timeout, the simulator
always says the timeout was for frame 0. I've changed worker.c
so that it tells which sequence number it timed out on. You
can get the new worker.c from the simulator directory. Let me
know if you find other bugs.

Also, if you haven't noticed, I've put a solution to project 1
in /cse/courses/cse461/simulator/solution1.

I don't think I'll be able to finish grading project 1 by
Wednesday. But if you're a C novice and want me to give you

ack timer in protocol 8

In p8.c, I had:

typedef enum {frame_arrival, cksum_err, timeout, network_layer_ready} event_type;

But in order to use the ack timer, it should be changed to:

typedef enum {frame_arrival, cksum_err, timeout, network_layer_ready, ack_timeout} event_type;

I've just fixed this in p8.c in the simulator directory.

You can start the ack timer by calling start_ack_timer() and
stop it by calling stop_ack_timer(). When the ack timer goes off,
an event ack_timeout occurs.

Queuing Theory
Date: Mon, 13 May 1996 09:51:34 PDT
From:
Richard Ladner <ladner@whalespout.cs.washington.edu>

I probably didn't explain myself very well.  Let me
give an example.

We have two incoming lines and one outgoing line to
a switch each with the same bandwidth b.
_____
|     |
A -------|     |
|     |-------- C
B -------|     |
|     |
-----

We know that cell arrivals on A are at a statistical
rate of b/2 and similarly for B.  Thus, the overall
arrival rate at the switch is b.  This will
cause the average queue length at the switch to be
infinity.  If the arrivals are Poisson, which
basically means that the arrivals are completely
independent, then it can be proven that this is true.

It appears on the surface that the switch can handle
the arrival rate of b.  Indeed it can, assuming it
has unbounded storage space.  If storage space is
bounded, then it will eventually overflow.

Question:

Regarding Assignment #8, we were wondering how the switch works.  Is
there one queue for all incoming traffic or are there separate queues for
each sender/receiver?  Are these channels independent of each other?

Answer:

The important thing is that there is a single buffer
pool for all arrivals.  When a packet arrives and
there is a buffer free it gets the packet.  The
full buffer is then put on the outgoing queue.
Once the packet is sent the buffer becomes free
again.

for your handwritten notes.  Be sure and leave some pages
for the final itself.

The final is 8:30 - 10:20 on Tuesday, June 4th.

I have special office hours today and Monday from 11 to
12.  If you need to make an appointment because you
cannot make those time, please send me e-mail.

I'm rooting for all of you to do well on the final.

Good luck,

Richard
