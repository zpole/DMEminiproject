The Space

The HUB Atrium Espresso Stand (TM) is planted in one corner of the
main HUB dining area. It commands a view of the terrace and the street
beyond. The general area around the stand is full of tables and is a
popular place for people to sit and study or talk long after they've
finished their coffee.
The Activity

The espresso stand sells espresso, cold drinks, tasty baked goods,
and the occasional sandwich. People typically come into the area, buy
a drink and a snack, and then either sit down at one of the tables or
go away. The stand is usually run by one or two servers, who take
orders, ring up customers, and prepare the drinks.

Observation

I observed the activity in and around the espresso stand one evening
between 5:00 and 6:00. I sat at several of the tables in the area, moving
around occasionally to get a view of different parts of the operation.
My observations are summarized in the following maps and notes.
