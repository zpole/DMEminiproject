SGI Indy Lab



The SGI Indy Instructional lab



The graphics instructional lab, located in Sieg Hall room 228, was
opened in September 1994. The lab was created through a donation by
Silicon Graphics Inc (SGI) of 14 Indy R4400s, one of which is shown
above.  These machines represent the state-of-the-art in
high-performance single-user multimedia workstations. They are
equipped with 24-bit color frame buffers, 19 inch color monitors, and
an Indycam, a small digital video camera.
The machines are named after characters appearing in various computer
generated animations:
