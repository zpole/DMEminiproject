142 Homework




CSE/ENGR 142: Homework

Homework assignments will be placed here as they are made. You
can see samples of old homework assignments by visiting the course
webs of
previous quarters
.

Homework assignments are generally distributed as self-extracting
"archives:" compressed files which when run expand into
a number of files.

Ordinarily, a new homework assignment will be available on the
day that the previous assignment was due.

If you have trouble downloading executable files via Netscape,
check out the
tip
on that
subject.
