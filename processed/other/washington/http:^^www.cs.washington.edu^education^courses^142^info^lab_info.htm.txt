Computing Lab Information




Computing Labs for CSE/ENGR 142


The IPL (Sieg 323)

Tentative regular hours (after the second week of the quarter):
7:30 am - 11:30 midnight M-Th
7:30 am - 6:00 pm F
9:00 am - 5:00 pm Sa
11:00 am- 11:30 pm Su
The Introductory Programming Laboratory (IPL) opens for business
with Autumn Quarter, 1996. The PCs are IBM-compatible and run
Windows 95. The C language compiler is Microsoft's Visual C++
(MSVC), version 4.2.
Consultants will be on duty in the lab frequently during the week.
They can help answer programming questions that arise while you
are working on homework in the lab. There are also lab assistants
on duty to check users in and out, to answer questions about operating
the equipment, and to retrieve print-outs.
If you plan to
compute at home
,
you will find it easiest if your system is very similar to the
lab set-up. To take the course, you will NOT be required to purchase
MSVC, but if you would like to, version 4.0 is available in the
University Bookstore at an educational discount. Currently the
price is about $55.00 plus tax. Version 4.2 is used in the IPL,
but the differences should not cause any difficulties for students
in this course. (This compiler will also be used for CSE 143 beginning
in Winter Quarter 1997.)
Platforms other than Win95 with MSVC 4.2 can be used, such as
a Macintosh with the Symantec Think C compiler, or a PC with Borland
C++. However, with these other systems you will get less help
from the course staff in making things work properly. Regardless
of your home equipment, there may still be times when you will
need to come to the computer lab in person.

Macintosh Lab (Sieg 324)


324 Sieg (543-9472). Hours are posted at the door. Normally the
lab is open
M-Th 8:30 a.m. - 10:30 p.m.
F 8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.
SS 11:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. (and Holidays)
In previous quarters, most 142 students used this laboratory equipped
with Macintosh computers. You may choose to use this lab, but
there will be no 142 consultants on duty, and in general the level
of support from 142 staff will be low. You will also not have
highest priority during times of peak use.

Other labs on campus



The Academic Computer Center (Brooklyn & Pacific) has some
PCs and a C++ compiler. They are generally open 24 hours a day
(except in summer). Hours for the ACC and other labs are available
on-line
.
Many other
computing services
and facilities are available at UW.
