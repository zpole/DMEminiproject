Ingolf Krüger



Hi there! This page has just recently been set up, so please bear with
me until the dust settles...
About Me
Welcome to my home page. I am a graduate student in
the Master's Degree program of the
Department of Computer Sciences
at the
University of Texas at Austin
. My
main interests in computer sciences are programming methodology and
the design, implementation and verification of distributed systems. I
will graduate in August 1996. My stay in the US is supported by the
Fulbright exchange program.

Research
Currently I am a member of
Prof. Misra
's
PSP Research Group
. As
part of my
Master's Thesis
I am working on a
compiler for the new
Seuss
programming language.
Before I came to Austin, I was studying at the
Department of Computer Science
of the
Technical
University of Munich
, Germany. There I have been involved in the
design and implementation of an interpreter for a concurrent, object
oriented programming language, called
DGOS
.
