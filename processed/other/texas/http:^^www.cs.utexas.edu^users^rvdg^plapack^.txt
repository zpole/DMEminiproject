Please sign our
guestbook
so we can keep you informed
The
PLAPACK
project investigates interfaces and implementations
of dense and sparse parallel linear algebra libraries.
This project is unique in that it concentrates on convenient
interfaces.  It is our conclusion that this can only be
achieved by distributing the
vectors
in a linear
system first, which then induces the
matrix
distribution.
Justification for this lies in the fact that the physical problem
leads to a mathematical model, involving two spaces and an operator.
It is these spaces that represent the problem.  Discretization
of the mathematical model leads to vectors, which hold the
solution and right hand side,
and the matrix, which is the discretized operator.
Physically Based Matrix Distribution
is based on these
ideas.  The interface that allows information from the
physical problem and/or mathematical model to be passed down
to the library is called the
Physically Distributed Matrix Interface
.

If you would like to be kept informed of progress on this library, please
sign our
guestbook.

The
SL_library
is a prototype implementation for PLAPACK.
Here
SL
stands for
S
imple
L
ibrary.
It was created in part
to investigate techniques required for the PLAPACK library,
and in part to provide an infrastructure for the course
"Parallel Techniques for Numerical Algorithms"
taught by
Robert van de Geijn
at
the University of Texas at Austin.



Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK):
Release R0.1 (Beta) Users' Guide

Manuscript in preparation, Aug. 1 version.

Using PLAPACK: Parallel Linear Algebra Package

PLAPACK Users' Guide, to be published by MIT Press in 1997.
Sept. 10, 1996 version.
In preparation.  Notice that we are changing a number of
calling sequences. Due to the inconsistency between the currently
available library and this guide, which reflects the next release,
it is important to sign our
guestbook,
so we can keep
you informed.
