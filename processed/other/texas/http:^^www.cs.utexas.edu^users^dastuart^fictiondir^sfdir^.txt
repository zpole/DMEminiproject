Fantasy and Science Fiction



THIS IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT


Fantasy and Science Fiction

I like fantasy and science fiction, although probably sf more than
fantasy, but f&sf is the way I felt like abbreviating it here.
I'm also going to include some pointers to other types of "literature",
but the main focus will be on f&sf that I enjoy.  Since I will read
just about anything, there is no telling what you will find here, but
I tend to prefer more light reading, so there won't be much dystopian
or depressing stuff.  Sorry, but that's what I like.
Most of what you will find here is lists and reviews, with perhaps the
random generic comments.


Science Fiction
There may be some overlap in the divisions below, but they seem to basically
work. Also, stuff is further organized by authors, so authors end up where
I feel like their work that I read belongs, although there may be some
overlap between fantasy and sf in the listings.


Space Opera
, especially E. E. "Doc" Smith

Military Science Fiction
, such as Pournelle, Drake, or Weber.

Hard Science Fiction
, such as Niven, Heinlein, or Asimov (hey I know its overbroad and vague).

Miscellaneous
(anything else (cyberpunk, social science fiction, post-apocalypse,
and the like)).
