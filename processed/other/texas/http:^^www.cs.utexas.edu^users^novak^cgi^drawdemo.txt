Lisp / X Drawing Demo

Drawing Program using Interactive X Graphics in Lisp
This is a demo of the
draw
program distributed with the
X Interface for Gnu Common Lisp
which is available as free software under the Gnu General Public License
from
ftp.ma.utexas.edu

When the demo is started, a drawing window is created.
Two menus are presented: a menu of drawing items and a menu of commands.
Select drawing items and then click the mouse one or more times inside
the drawing area.
The
Make LaTeX
command can be used to create LaTeX commands
to produce the drawing.
LaTeX Mode
will restrict lines to
lines that LaTeX can draw.  Note, however, that LaTeX cannot produce all
the things that can be drawn.  The LaTeX code is served to you in a file
that is presented after the program terminates.

Instructions



You must be logged in to a host running X windows.
Type
xhost + www.cs.utexas.edu
(exactly as shown
at left) in a window on that host
to allow this server to write to your display.
Enter your X display name here if needed; you may need to change
what is shown in the box to your X display name.  For example,
myterminal.cs.utexas.edu:0.0



Click
to start the demo.
