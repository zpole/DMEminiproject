Unit Conversion Demo

Conversion of Units of Measurement
This is a demonstration of a program that converts between different units
of measurement, or combinations of units.  It can also simplify
expressions of units.
A units expression is a unit name, such as
meter
,
a number such as
2.5
, a product of two or more unit expressions
(* expr1 ... exprn)
,
or a quotient of two unit expressions
(/ expr1 expr2)
.
Common abbreviations such as
ft
are allowed.
An example is
(/ (* atto parsec) (* micro fortnight))
.
When the program is started, a window is created containing a command menu
and input and output areas.  Click the appropriate menu items to run
the demo.
