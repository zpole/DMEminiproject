Lisp / X Demo

Demonstration of Interactive X Graphics from Lisp
This is a demo of the
X Interface for Gnu Common Lisp
which is available as free software under the Gnu General Public License
from
ftp.ma.utexas.edu

When the demo is started, a window is created and some things are
drawn in it.  A menu of options is presented; select an option
and then click the mouse one or more times inside the graphics window.

The code
is fairly simple.

Instructions



You must be logged in to a host running X windows.
Type
xhost + www.cs.utexas.edu
(exactly as shown
at left) in a window on that host
to allow this server to write to your display.
Enter your X display name here if needed; you may need to change
what is shown in the box to your X display name.  For example,
myterminal.cs.utexas.edu:0.0



Click
to start the demo.
