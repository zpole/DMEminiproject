I am currently in my fifth year of a doctoral program in Educational
Psychology.  My current research involves human motivation and the way
that peoples' conceptions of the future affect their motivation.  I have
a wonderful talent for getting in over my head and getting it all
done. ;-) (I must know I have some limitations.  I decided that I would
not attempt to learn how to make a home page from the beginning two days
before this was due, during the worst part of the semester.)
The topics which I find interesting.... Unfortunately most everything is
interesting to me.  I am particularly enthralled with: language acquisition
(first and second), evolution of language, causal reasoning, and the
philosophy that underlies cognitive science.
