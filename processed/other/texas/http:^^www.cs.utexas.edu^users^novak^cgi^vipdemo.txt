VIP Demo

Programming and Problem Solving by Connecting Diagrams
This is a demonstration of the VIP (View Interactive Programming) program.
VIP allows the user to create scientific programs or to solve physics
problems by connecting diagrams that represent physical and
mathematical principles.  The following example shows a specification
for calculating the mass of the sun, following Newton's reasoning,
by equating the gravitational attraction of the sun on the earth with
the force required to keep the earth in circular motion.


When the program is started, a window is created with a command menu
and input and output areas.  Use the command Output Language to select
the desired language for the program that is created.  (The actual
program will be served to you in a file that is presented after the
demo program is terminated.)  Use the input lines to specify the name
and type of each input variable, one per line, in the format shown.
Examples are
(radius integer)
and
(speed (units real mph))
.
Then select the command New Program to start VIP.
A VIP program is created by connecting diagram boxes that represent
variables and physical and mathematical principles.  A connection
signifies that two quantities are equal.  To make a connection,
click the mouse, once for each end of the connection, on variable boxes
or on "buttons" associated with diagrams.  To get a useful program, there
must be a connection to the
OUTPUT
box.
The VIP commands are as follows:


Done
Finished; make a program from the diagram.

Redo
Start over.

Move
Move a box.  Click the box you wish to move.

Delete
Delete a box or a connection.

Geometry
Select a new geometric principle box.

Physics
Select a new physical principle box.

Make Var
Make a local variable.

Specify Type
Specify the type of a variable.
This can also be used to specify units.

OP
Make an operation box, such as
+ - * /
.

Type-in
Type in a numeric constant, with units if
desired.

Constant
Select a predefined constant,
such as the speed of light.


Instructions



You must be logged in to a host running X windows.
Type
xhost + www.cs.utexas.edu
(exactly as shown
at left) in a window on that host
to allow this server to write to your display.
Enter your X display name here if needed; you may need to change
what is shown in the box to your X display name.  For example,
myterminal.cs.utexas.edu:0.0
