About me
I graduated from
Peking University
in 1992.
That was a long time ago. I got a master in the
Physics Department
in
the University
of Texas at Austin
. Then, one year ago, I move my seat into the
Computer Science
department and got
another master this spring. Seems I had the intension to
stay in school for ever.
