AT LAST!
Warner Brothers is set to release the
Mark Snow
X-Files Soundtrack
:
"The
Truth and The Light"
on October 8, 1996.  Hurrah!!!  Although the
web page doesn't include sound-bites (like "Key of X's" does), it does
include an nice bit of biography about Mr. Snow, track information
about the disk itself, and the hugest list of X-Files web sites I've
ever seen.

This way to Warner Brother's sample-filled(!) page for their
release (March 26, 1996) of the
Songs in the Key of X
.
As you have probably heard, this disc will have Mark Snow's Theme
song, and then the rest will be non-X-soundtrack music done by various
artists, who were inspired by the show (ok, so Nick Cave's "Red Right
Hand" is in there too.) That cover gives me the willies!  Audio samples
of excellent quality.

Cliff also maintains the
X-Files 20 Questions
.  Read before posting to X-Files newsgroups!

'Deep Background' frequently asked questions

Pat Gonzales also keeps up the
'Creative' Groups' FAQ
for prospective fanfictioneres.

Try out the (very impressive) Entertainment Weekly article
"The X-Files Exposed"
by Dana Kennedy, with photographs by
William Mercer.  (Also try out the other EW stuff -
this
is what the web will become!)
Note, however, that you will have
to register - at no charge - with their service.
This will allow
them to tailor future services to the needs people like you (I guess. :-)
Try Hans Larsen's
Norwegian X-Files
site.  Very impressive graphical interface!
Another
extremely
impressive site is the
Web page of the AOL X-Files Forum.
A high-energy group of fans!

(The word "official", as any advertising droid will tell you, is used
to leverage (they
love
that word) profits.)  They've done a
very
nice job with this page.
