ACM SIGACT


ACM SIGACT




SIGACT, the Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory,
is the
ACM
special interest group for Theoretical Computer Science.
Theoretical Computer Science provides the fundamental concepts, principles,
and techniques needed to understand and cope with the rapidly changing field
of computer technology.
SIGACT members are interested in diverse topics such as
algorithm design and analysis,
automata and formal languages,
complexity theory,
computational geometry,
computational learning theory,
computational number theory,
computability theory,
cryptography,
databases,
logic of programs,
parallel and distributed computation,
semantics of programming languages,
and
VLSI layout and design.
The membership is unified by their mathematically rigorous approach
to computational problems.
SIGACT's role is to foster and promote the
discovery and dissemination of research results, and excellence in
instruction at all levels.
You are visitor number
since November 1, 1995.

SIGACT News






SIGACT publishes a quarterly print newsletter,
SIGACT News
,
which serves as a forum for issues of interest to the theoretical
computer science community.  Readers can keep abreast of professional events
and announcements, and benefit from regular technical columns written
by respected professionals in key areas of theoretical computer science.
In addition, the non-technical columns, letters to the Editor, and minutes
of professional meetings help keep the reader up-to-date on issues of
importance to professional theoretical computer scientists.  The
Education Forum provides insight into the latest teaching methods and material,
and provides previews of recent or upcoming textbooks.
SIGACT News Online

SIGACT News Online
,
the electronic version of
SIGACT News
,
was launched in September 1996 with issue #100.
Access is limited to current SIGACT members.
Each issue of
SIGACT News Online
mirrors a print issue of
SIGACT News
,
and is available as a collection of
postscript documents and scanned images.

WWW Pages
SIGACT maintains some web pages of general interest to
theoretical computer scientists, including the following.
TCS Virtual Address Book



The
TCS Virtual Address Book
lists the WWW pages of theoretical computer scientists worldwide,
and includes an electronic form to enter your URL.

Theory Calendar



The theory calendar is available in
postscript
format.
There is also a
hypertext
document with links to the WWW pages for theory conferences.

TCS Genealogy



The SIGACT
Theoretical
Computer Science Genealogy
lists information on the intellectual "family trees" of
earned doctoral degrees (adviser, university, and year)
of theoretical computer scientists worldwide.
It includes an automatic form for you to submit entries
for yourself and your students.  The database is updated
several times a year.
