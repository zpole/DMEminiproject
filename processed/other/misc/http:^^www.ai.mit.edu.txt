The principal goals of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory are to
develop a computational theory of intelligence and to develop high-impact
practical applications in areas such as information transportation, enhanced
reality, the human-computer interface, modeling and simulation, image
understanding, decision analysis and impact prediction, model-based
engineering design, medicine, and supporting computing technology.
