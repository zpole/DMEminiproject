W.M. Keck Center for Computational Biology







Updated December 19, 1996

The W. M. Keck Center for Computational Biology in Houston, Texas offers
advanced training in computational biology at the graduate and
postdoctoral level and special programs for undergraduates and
Houston high-school students through its three partner institutions:
Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, and the University
of Houston.
Science and engineering are in the process of being transformed
by the power of new computing technologies.  Our goal is to
train a new kind of scientist--one poised to seize the advantages
of a national computational prowess in solving important problems
in biology.
Our training program emphasizes algorithm development, computation, and
visualization in the areas of biology, biochemistry and biophysics.
The research groups involved in the W. M. Keck Center for
Computational Biology are at the forefronts of their respective
areas and their laboratories are outstanding settings provide an
outstanding research environment.
