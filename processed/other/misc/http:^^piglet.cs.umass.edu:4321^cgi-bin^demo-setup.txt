Select-a-Demo
Submitting the following form will run a demo which will attempt to
pop a window up on your screen.  If necessary, put your console host
in the entry marked
X Display
.

You will also need to type

xhost +piglet.cs.umass.edu

in a shell to allow piglet to set up a window on your screen.
The
demo will not work otherwise!

There is a 10 minute timeout.
Note: Piglet is a SPARCstation 2 under variable load -- some demos
may slow down or momentarily stop, depending on piglet's work load.
