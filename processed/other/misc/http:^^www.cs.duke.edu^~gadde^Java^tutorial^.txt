Getting Started
The most common Java programs are applications and applets.
Applications
are standalone programs,
such as the HotJava browser.
Applets
are similar to applications,
but they don't run standalone.
Instead, applets adhere to a set of conventions
that lets them run within a Java-compatible browser.
If you're using a browser that can view applets,
you should see an animation just below this paragraph --
that's an applet embedded in this HTML page.















The "Hello World" Application
--
Start here if you want to create standalone Java applications.









The "Hello World" Applet
--
Start here if you are interested in writing applets only.






What Next?
Now that you've seen how to write a Java program,
you can proceed with any of the topics below.








Writing Java Programs
--
These lessons discuss techniques and concepts
that any Java programmer can use.
The book version of this tutorial breaks this trail in two:


Writing Java Programs
,
which contains the first three lessons shown on the index page
for the trail.

Using the Core Java Classes
,
which contains the remaining six lessons.










Writing Applets
--
These lessons discuss techniques and concepts
that are specific to writing Java applets.









Creating a User Interface
--
Here's the information you need
to create the user interface of your applet or application.









Custom Networking and Security
--
The lessons on this trail
teach you how to connect your applications and applets
to the information on the Internet! Also, this trail contains
a lesson that shows you how you can create an install your own
security manager which can help to protect your computer and data
from violation.









Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs
--
These lessons show you everything you need to know to
write native methods in the Java language. A native method is a Java method
whose implementation is provided in another programming language such as C.
This lesson includes step-by-step instructions
and a comprehensive example program.
