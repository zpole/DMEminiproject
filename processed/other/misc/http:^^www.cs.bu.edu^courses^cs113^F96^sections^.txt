using a
recursive
model of an expression.

Often discussions will be in the UNIX lab (B24).  When I plan to have
discussions in the computer labs, I put a sign outside the assigned
classroom.

Each of the 2 discussions will cover roughly the same material
as the other.  If you cannot make the discussion that
you are assigned to, feel free to come to the other one;
however, the number of computers in the lab are limited.
