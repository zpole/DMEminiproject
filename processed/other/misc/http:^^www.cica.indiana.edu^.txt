the Center for Innovative Computer Applications












The
Center for Innovative Computer Applications
is a special projects unit
of
University Computing Services
at
Indiana University
charged with
exploring applications of new computing technologies.
We focus on scientific and artistic visualization, high-end computing,
and other special applications.



High-Performance Computing

CICA's
High-Performance Computing
Support Group provides assistance
in developing supercomputing applications and provides consultation
in the use of IU's Paragon and SP2 parallel supercomputers.
Don Berry
has been conducting experiments to compare various methods of
distributed computing for both speed of execution and ease of
programming.
The images below show four different
runs of a heat diffusion simulation running on 1, 2, 4, and
8 processors.  At a given elapsed time (150 seconds in this case),
the progress of the computations can be visualized and compared.
(The lower the "bump", the further the computation has progressed.)
This simulation was coded in High-Performance
Fortran and was run on IU's SP2 supercomputer.
