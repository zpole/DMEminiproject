OMNICAM: OMNIDIRECTIONAL VIDEO CAMERA



The
Computer Vision Laboratory
of the
Department of Computer
Science
at
Columbia University
introduces
OMNICAM
, a video camera that can "see"
in all directions.

The optics of the sensor has been designed to ensure that all points in
the world are projected through a single center of projection. This allows
the
OMNIVIDEO
software to generate pure perspective images at video
rate for any user-selected viewing direction and magnification.






Come to the entrance of the Computer Science Department at 450 Mudd
Hall to interact with
OMNICAM
and
OMNIVIDEO
!

Software





The
OMNICAM
video sensor was developed by
Prof.  Shree K. Nayar
of
the Department of Computer Science. The
OMNIVIDEO
software system
was developed by
Venkat
Peri
of the Department of Computer Science. All technical inquiries
related to the
OMNICAM
sensor and
OMNIVIDEO
software may
be directed to Prof. Shree K. Nayar. All licensing inquiries may be directed
to
Dr. Fred Kant
