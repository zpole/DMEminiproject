The Maisie Visual Programming Environment (MVP
E
)
is an X-windows based graphical front-end for designing parallel
simulations in
Maisie
, a parallel
(message-passing) extension of C.  It is written in C++ using Motif.
It is similar in intent to OPNET (which simulates networks), and
SESworkbench.  The primary advantage of MVP
E
over
these commercial systems is its direct use of a parallel simulation
language.



Features


entities (entity types) are specified using an extended flow
chart notation
(sample)

simulations can be designed hierarchically with arbitrary depth
static communication topology is specified graphically
automatic code generation, compilation, and execution
Among the extensions planned for future releases are:

automatic partitioning
runtime animation
metrics collection
libraries of predefined entities
The following information is also available.

Abstract: Simulation is an increasingly important aspect of network development, and parallelization of these simulations can result in tremendous time/performance improvements.  However, tools for developing and parallelizaing simulations are sadly lacking.  This paper describes MVP
E
, a visual programming environment for parallel simulation design.


This research has been funded as part of the
WAMIS
and
TRAVLER
projects.
