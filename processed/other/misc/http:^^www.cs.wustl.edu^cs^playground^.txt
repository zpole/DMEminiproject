The Programmers' Playground
Playground is a
programming model
and
a set of
software tools
to support end-user construction of distributed multimedia applications
from modular software building blocks.
Features include a separation of communication from computation,
dynamic reconfiguration, and uniform treatment of discrete and
continuous data types.  This
color poster
summarizes some of
Playground's features.








Programming Model
Playground is based on
I/O Abstraction,
a programming model in which each module of a distributed
system interacts with an external environment through a narrow
data interface.  The model supports a separation of active and reactive
control and inherits ideas from the formal I/O automaton
model.








Software Tools
Playground provides
sofware tools
to support
development of Playground modules in C++, end-user graphical
configuration of those modules into distributed applications,
and end-user construction of
constraint-based direct-manipulation
graphical user interfaces for those distributed applications.








Can I Play?
Yes! Try these
cool demos
, or you can
become a Playground user
and create
your own distributed applications.








Courses
An
undergraduate lab course
in distributed applications
was offered recently using the Playground software.  The materials
are available for course adoption.








Publications
These
papers
describe the programming model and
software tools in more detail.








People
Meet the Distributed Programming Environments Group.








Funding
Research and development for The Programmers' Playground has been
supported by Washington University and
these
sponsors.
