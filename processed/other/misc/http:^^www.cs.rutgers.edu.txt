Research Programs
This section will describe on-line information about faculty research


The
Mobile
Wireless Computing
at Rutgers (The
DATAMAN
group) Project
investigates protocols, services, and other issues involved in being
wireless-ly "on-line".  The DATAMAN group recently received grants
from NSF and ARPA.
The
CAM Project
(Content Adressable Memories) attempts to design and build an architecture,
using the concepts of associative
processing, that overcomes the shortcomings of conventional
vonNeumann machines in dealing with applications involving massive
amounts of data.
The
HPCD Project
attempts to build on advances in massively parallel computing
and in computer science and to develop a new generation of engineering
automation technology that can bring about dramatic gains in
productivity of the national industrial base.
The
PROLANGS Research Group
(
Pro
gramming
Lang
uage
s
) studies code transformation,
semantic analysis, parallel hybrid analysis, and other aspects for
writing and optimizing programming languages.
DIMACS
is the National
Science Foundation Science and Technology Center for Discrete
Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science.Permanent Members of
DIMACS include the researchers in theoretical computer science and
discrete mathematics from appropriate units at Rutgers University,
Princeton University, AT&T Research, Lucent Technologies, and
Bellcore.
