Switzerland (Project MAC)

MIT Project on Mathematics and Computation
"Neutral, but heavily armed."
Project Mac, associated with both the
MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab
and
the
MIT Laboratory for Computer Science
, builds a wide spectrum of
intelligent computational tools to help scientists and engineers
understand mathematical models of physical processes.


Look here for an
Overview of our research
.

One of our major current activities is the study of
Amorphous
Computing


As part of our artificial intelligence work, we also study the
problem of learning in the context of language.
Learning MorphoPhonology


Most of our work uses the
Scheme dialect of Lisp
, for which we
developed and maintain the MIT Scheme implementation.
