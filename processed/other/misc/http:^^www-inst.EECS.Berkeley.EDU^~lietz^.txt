The following models are elements from the Soda Hall model created by the
Berkeley WALKTHRU Project
led by
Professor Carlo Sequin
.  This 3-dimensional building model is used as the basis for various research projects, many of which focus on the issues of real-time interactive environments.  In conjunction with the Walkthrough group, I converted the Soda Hall model from its original format, Unigrafix, to VRML.
Note: a VRML browser is required to see the following images in their full glory.  Otherwise, you will have to simply revel in the splendid code.
