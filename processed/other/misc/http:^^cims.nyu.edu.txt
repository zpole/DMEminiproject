About The Institute

New York
University
is among the nation's largest private universities.
Founded in 1831, it awards degrees in a wide variety of fields,
including the humanities, science, business, law, the fine arts, the
performing arts, public administration, medicine, dentistry, education,
and social work.  Among the University's divisions is the Courant
Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a center for research and advanced
training in mathematics and computer science. The Institute has long
been a leader in mathematical analysis, applied mathematics, and
scientific computation, with special emphasis on partial differential
equations and their applications. In computer science, the Institute
excels in theory, programming languages, computer graphics, and parallel
computing. Mathematics and computer science are viewed as living parts
of the stream of science, not as isolated specialties.  For more
