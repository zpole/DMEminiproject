Document Information Server Design and Usage







The Server is provided as a repository for information, data, and public
domain code relating to the field of document image understanding.  Although
the core resources will be compiled by researchers at the University of
Maryland, the success of such a system depends on user support and
contributions.

Server Access
Users will be able to access the server in several ways.  The primary
access to the server is through the WWW server.  Large files or binary
files can be transfered by FTP.  Anonymous FTP access is available for
selected files at documents.cfar.umd.edu.  For users who do not have
direct internet access, a ListServer has been implemented and will
eventually allow access to many of the files on the server.
