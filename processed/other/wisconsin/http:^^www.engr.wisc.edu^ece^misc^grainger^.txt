T
he Grainger Foundation has established a major
new award program for UW-Madison students who earn an undergraduate or
graduate degree with a specialization in electric power engineering.
These awards are intended to reward highly qualified and motivated
students following programs of study in electric machines and drive
systems, industrial motion control, power electronics and electric
power systems.
Up to 20 awards of $5,000 each will be given in May 1997 and again in
