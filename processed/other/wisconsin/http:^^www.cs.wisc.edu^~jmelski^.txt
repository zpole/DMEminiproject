second coming



home


welcome to the second incarnation of eric melski's homepage.

this page used to be about me, but i don't think most people really want
to know my life story.  still, i feel that i must say at least something
about myself.  i'm 19, a sophomore at the
university of wisconsin in madison, and i'm majoring in computer science.
i enjoy computer programming, alternative music, and life in general.
i work at the computer systems lab at the university, where i have
recently taken over as dumpmaster. this is good because now i have a
title with the word 'master' in it. i retain my cookie purchasing duties,
as i am the only person i trust to get good cookies.
i'm originally from marshfield, wi, and before that, from newton, ma.
but for now, madison is where i belong.
explore my pages.
