Correctness of an Algorithm for Reconstituting a Program from a Dependence Graph

Correctness of an Algorithm for Reconstituting a Program from a Dependence Graph
Thomas J. Ball,  Susan Horwitz and  Thomas Reps
CS-TR-90-947
July 1990
Given an arbitrary program dependence graph, the algorithm ReconstituteProgram determines whether the graph is \fIfeasible\fP (\fIi.e.\fP, is the dependence graph of some program), and if so produces such a program. ReconstituteProgram is currently used for program integration, and has the potential to be used by other algorithms that manipulate program dependence graphs. This paper corrects a minor error that was in the original definition of ReconstituteProgram, and proves that the new version of the algorithm is correct.
