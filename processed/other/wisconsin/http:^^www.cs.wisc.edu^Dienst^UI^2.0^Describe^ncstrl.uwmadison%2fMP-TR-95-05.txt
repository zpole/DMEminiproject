Hybrid Misclassification Minimization

Hybrid Misclassification Minimization

Given two finite point sets \SA and \SB in the n-dimensional real space
R^n
, we consider the NP-complete problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by a plane attempting to divide
R^n
into two halfspaces such that each open halfspace contains points mostly of \SA or \SB. This problem is equivalent to determining a plane
\{ x \mid x^T w= \gamma \}
that maximizes the number of points
x \in
\SA satisfying
x^T w > \gamma
, plus the number of points
x \in
\SB satisfying
x^T w
<
\gamma
. A simple but fast algorithm is proposed that alternates between (i) minimizing the number of misclassified points by translation of the separating plane, and (ii) a rotation of the plane so that it minimizes a weighted average sum of the distances of the misclassified points to the separating plane. Existence of a global solution to an underlying hybrid minimization problem is established. Computational comparison with a parametric approach to solve the NP-complete problem indicates that our approach is considerably faster and appears to generalize better as determined by tenfold cross-validation.
