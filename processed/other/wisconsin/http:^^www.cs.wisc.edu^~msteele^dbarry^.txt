Dave Who?


No, not Dave Who, Dave
Barry
.  Dave Barry is a syndicated
columnist whose humorous articles appear in hundreds of newspapers
every week.  When he's not writing his columns for the enjoyment of the
world, he writes for the Miami Herald's Tropic Magazine.  Dave has won
a Pulitzer Prize for his humor columns (for several of his columns in
the category of Distinguished Social Commentary in 1988) and is the lead
guitarist in a rock band called the
Rock Bottom Remainders
.
Plus, Dave is the leader of the Urban Professionals and an all-around
nice guy who tries to protect his readers from the dangers of the world
around them, like exploding cows and trout falling from the sky.  This
newsgroup is *not* about David Barry, the auto writer for Vogue
Magazine.

Is there a mailing list version of this newsgroup?


Nope.


How can I Write to Dave?


To write to Dave Barry (and get your very own postcard reply from "The
Man" himself), write to:
Dave Barry
c/o Tropic Magazine
Miami Herald
1 Herald Plaza
Miami, FL  33132



Does Dave read this newsgroup?

Yup.  He even posts once in a while.

Can I send E-Mail to Dave?

Yup.

Well?  Aren't you going to tell me his address?

If you had millions of fans who all wanted to have frequent, personal,
e-mail conversations with you, you'd probably feel flattered for the
first 5 minutes, and then spend the rest of your life regretting that
you told anyone your e-mail address.
Dave doesn't want his address in the FAQ, for pretty much the above
reason.  Plus, he says he gets too much regular paper-mail to keep up
with, let alone trying to manage fan e-mail too.  If you really want
it, watch the group for one of his posts and get the address off that.
But Dave would just as soon have you post to
alt.fan.dave_barry
rather
than send personal mail, and he'll see your note on the newsgroup.


Is there a non-Internet Dave Barry Fan Club?


Why, yes there is...  The Dave Barry Fan Club puts out a newsletter
three times a year entitled "We're Not Making This Up" which features
info about Dave and personal letters from him (he fills out a questionairre
for each issue).  To recieve the newsletter (through regular mail,
not e-mail) send $6 ($4.50 for members of
Mensa
) for a year (or $1 for
a 1 issue sample) to:
Rocky Lefarth
PO Box 510523
St. Louis, MO  63151

Contact Barbara Ploegstra
(bploegst@smtpgwy.ssmhc.com)
for more
information.


Recently, Dave had a "Worst Song" Contest.  What did he pick as the worst
Rock and Roll Song of All Time?


"MacArthur Park", written by Jim Webb, performed by Richard Harris in 1968
and later in 1978 by Donna Summer.


On the Topic of Bad Music, What's That Band that Dave's In?


Dave is the lead guitarist for the rock band,
The Rock Bottom Remainders
.
The group includes such popular writers as Dave Barry (lead guitar,vocals),
Stephen King (rhythm guitar,vocals), Ridley Pearson (bass guitar), Amy Tan
(vocals), Barbara Kingsolver (keyboards), Robert Fulghum (backup vocals),
Roy Blount Jr. (backup vocals), Dave Marsh (backup vocals), Tad Bartimus
(backups vocals), and organizer Kathi Goldmark (backup vocals).  The group
was put together by Goldmark at a writers convention in 1991.  They named
the band after the bookstore practice of selling last year's bestsellers at
bargain rates.  Music veteren Al Kooper is the band's musical director and
plays keyboards and guitar with the band.  The group went on its first tour
in May, 1993, with the proceeds going to the Right to Rock Network and a
variety of literacy and First Amendment organizations.  Their motto is, "We
play music as well as Metallica writes novels."
A book about the Rock Bottom Remainders has been published, entitled
Mid-Life Confidential:  The Rock
Bottom Remainders Tour America with Three Chords and an Attitude
.


What is Tropic Hunt?


Tropic Hunt is a combination scavenger hunt and brain puzzle held in the Miami
area which is hosted by the
Miami Herald's
Tropic Magazine.  It will
be held in November this year.
Dave is one of the Hunt's creators and he helps organize it.  Asides from
that, it's hard to explain.
