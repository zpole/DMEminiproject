Proceedings: ML95 Workshop on `Agents that Learn from Other Agents'



Agents that Learn from Other Agents
This is the on-line proceedings of the
workshop on
Agents that Learn from Other Agents
held as part of the
1995 International Machine Learning Conference
.
Led by an invited talk by
Tom Mitchell
of Carnegie-Mellon University,
eleven reports about current research on this topic were presented.

Introduction
There has been a growing trend in machine learning toward learning
methods that involve interacting with other agents.
One such interaction is via advice-taking
(Suddarth & Holden 1991),
which may well turn out to be the
most efficient method for building software-agent architectures.  Instruction is
steadily increasing in popularity as a method for agent learning (e.g.,
Gordon & Subramanian 1993,
Huffman & Laird 1993,
Lin 1993,
Maclin & Shavlik 1994,
Noelle & Cotrell 1994,
Tecuci, Hieb, Hille, & Pullen 1994).
Meanwhile, there is also
an active interest in agents that learn from observation (e.g.,
Iba 1991,
Lin 1993),
as well as agents that communicate and learn from each other
(e.g.,
Etzioni & Weld 1994,
Lashkari, Metral, & Maes 1994, Tan 1993).
Furthermore, in the COLT community there have been a number of papers
on team learning (e.g.,
Daley, Kalyanasundaram, & Velauthapillai 1993).
For these reasons, the main focus of
this workshop was on learning from instruction or observation, rather than the
environment. The instructors might be humans or other automated agents.
