Major testing machines and available instruments fall into these classifications


Materials and Structures


Tension/Compression: 20 machines with load capacities ranging from 100 lb. to 1 million lb.
Torsion: 3 table-top machines (5,000 in.-lb.)


Structures
(large)


Tension/Compression: 6 machines with load capacities ranging from 5,000 lb. to 1 million lb.


Vibrations
(small specimens)
