UW DBMS Research
The research interests of the DBMS group at Madison are wide and
varied.  A good overview of ongoing work can be found by reading the
home pages of the faculty, and by reading about the various software
projects that are underway.

People
The DBMS research group at UW-Madison is made up of a large group of
faculty, students and staff.  The "official" DBMS faculty include:


Mike Carey
(Now at IBM Almaden.)

David DeWitt


Yannis Ioannidis


Jeff Naughton


Raghu Ramakrishnan

Additionally,
Miron Livny
and
Marvin
Solomon
are involved in DBMS research in conjunction with their
other interests.
The bulk of the group is made up of a number of
graduate students
, and also a dedicated crew of full
time
staff
.  We also have a large and
distinguished group of
alumni and alumnae
.

UW DBMS software projects.
Information, technical reports, and (sometimes) source code are
available for the following UW DBMS software packages:


CORAL
, a deductive DBMS.

EXODUS/E
,
an Extensible Object-Oriented Database System Toolkit

OO7
, an OODBMS benchmark.

PARADISE
, a
Geographic Information System built on SHORE.

SHORE
, a
High-Performance, Scalable, Persistent Object Repository.
zetaSim, a parallel DBMS simulator.  (link under construction)
ZOO, a database system for scientific experiment management (link
under construction)



DBMS-Related Mailing Lists
We maintain two mailing lists targeted toward the UW DBMS community:



dbseminar
is for announcements about DBMS-related talks
and academic activities in the department.  The weekly Database
Seminar is usually held Friday afternoons at 1:15PM, in 2310 CS.


dbpilgrims
is for announcements of social events
(especially "pilgrimages" to the Memorial Union), birthday cake
distributions, and other
diversions.  Though targeted at the DBMS group, we welcome
wannabes.


To subscribe to either of these lists:
These lists are
maintained via the listproc package.  To subscribe to a list, send
e-mail to
listproc@cs.wisc.edu
, with a message (not a Subject line!)
containing only the words:
subscribe <list name> <your name in real life>
As an example, one database wannabe might send the message:
To: listproc@cs.wisc.edu
Subject: I wannabe!

subscribe dbpilgrims Alan Turing
Unsubscribing is similar:
To: listproc@cs.wisc.edu
Subject: can't make it any more

unsubscribe dbpilgrims



Pointers to other database information

The best source of additional database-related information is the
ACM-SIGMOD home page.

Aoki
maintains a list of pointers

other
random DBMS information

Michael Ley
maintains a
compendium of info on database systems and logic programming
