Machine Learning via Polyhedral Concave Minimization

Machine Learning via Polyhedral Concave Minimization
O. L. Mangasarian
MP-TR-95-20
November 1995
Two fundamental problems of machine learning, misclassification minimization and feature selection, are formulated as the minimization of a concave function on a polyhedral set. Other formulations of these problems utilize linear programs with equilibrium constraints which are generally intractable. In contrast, for the proposed concave minimization formulation, a successive linearization algorithm without stepsize terminates after a maximum average of 7 linear programs on problems with as many as 2124 points in 2082-dimensional space. The algorithm terminates at a stationary point or a global solution to the problem. Preliminary numerical results indicate that the proposed approach is quite effective and more efficient than other approaches.
