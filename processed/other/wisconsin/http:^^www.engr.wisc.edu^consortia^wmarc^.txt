The Wisconsin Manufacturing Automation and Robotics Consortium (WMARC)
was established in 1984 to formalize, coordinate and enhance
industry/university interactions in manufacturing automation and
robotics.
Current research topics include sensor development for manufacturing
process automations, networking in flexible manufacturing and
robotics, ultra high-speed materials transport systems,
sensor-integrated manufacturing and robotics, CAD/CAM systems for
automation, inspection integrated manufacturing, and control system
design for multi-degree-of-freedom automation systems.
Benefits to industrial sponsors include access to research results
from combined funding, access to advanced technology, contact with
degree candidates and faculty, access to technical and annual reports,
annual technology transfer meetings, faculty exchanges, participation
in advanced training of students, and special rights to participate in
patents and inventions.

Industrial Sponsors:
Alcoa Corp., Allen Bradley Corp., ASEA Brown
Boveri Inc., Fort Howard Paper Co., Gleason Works Inc., Marquip Inc.,
Oscar Mayer, Renishaw Inc.
