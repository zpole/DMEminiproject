College Consortia






The college shares expertise and data with government and industry
through its research consortia.
Involving researchers, faculty and industrial sponsors, consortia are
formed to study specific technical areas. Companies may join by paying
fees and participating in consortia activities. Members see work in
progress, help to set research directions, and interact with faculty
and students.
