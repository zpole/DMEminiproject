Research Centers






The UW-Madison College of Engineering is a national and international
leader in the establishment and support of various interdisciplinary
research centers. These college centers complement the activities
being done in departments and degree-granting programs.
The centers combine the talents of researchers in engineering and
other related disciplines to work toward common research goals. This
model of research activity is believed to be the most effective
approach to answering many of the complex engineering research
questions of the future.
Only official centers are listed here.  If you cannot find what you are
