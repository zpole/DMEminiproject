Where did I get these pictures from?
Maryland's
Computer
Vision
research group (specifically
Ross Cutler
) needed test subjects for a
project involving infrared images.  So, they asked for volunteers,
promising a copy of our photos when they were done.
Being the sucker for cool stuff like this that I am, I signed up and
got my picture taken.
