CS/ECE 752 Fall 1996-1997




CS/ECE 752: Advanced Computer Architecture I

Fall 1996-1997 Offering

Instructor:
Mark D. Hill
and TA:
Jeff Shabel

URL: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~markhill/cs752/

Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and
interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets
functional, performance and cost goals.  This course qualitatively and
quantitatively examines computer design tradeoffs.  We will learn, for
example, how uniprocessors execute many instructions concurrently
and why state-of-the-art memory systems are nearly as complex as processors.
Examining tradeoffs requires that you already know how to design a
correct computer, as is taught is the important prerequisite CS/ECE
552.  CS 537 is also a prerequisite, but it is less important, and may
be taken concurrently or adequately covered with external reading.

Project
The default project is to do some original research in a group of three
students.  For example, you could examine a modest extension to a paper
studied in class or simply re-validate the data in some paper by
writing your own simulator. Alternatively, you may work in a group of
two to write a paper that surveys an area within computer
architecture.  Projects will include an oral presentation and a paper.


Assignment


Examinations
There will be two midterm exams, but no final exam.  The midterms are
listed in in the Approximate Outline.  Please advise me of any
conflicts with these likely exam times before the end of the second
week of classes.
Homework
There will be several assignments.  Many assignments will require the
review of material that is touched upon, but not covered in depth in
class.  Assignments will not be weighted equally.  The approximate
weights of each assignment will be specified when the assignment is
handed out.  Assignments will be due in class on the due date.  NO LATE
ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED, except under extreme non-academic
circumstances discussed with the instructor at least one week before
the assignment is due.

Homework 0, Do NOT TURN IN, but you may optionally do it to refresh your knowledge (== Homework 1 from Fall 1994):
