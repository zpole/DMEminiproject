Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics
(WCSAR)



Program Mission
The Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics (WCSAR) has the
primary mission of working closely with industry to identify new
commercial markets, and to develop new products and new technologies to
successfully address those markets.  The emphasis is on technology
commercialization, wherein the industry colleagues actively participate
from the earliest stages of product identification and development.
WCSAR's main expertise is with advanced closed controlled environment
systems.  Specifically, WCSAR and its partners have developed the highly
successful suite of technologies collectively known as
ASTROCULTURE
(tm),
for the long-term growth and maintenance of plant materials in
microgravity.
ASTROCULTURE
(tm) hardware has flown on five Space Shuttle
missions, the most recent being the
Second United States Microgravity
Laboratory (USML-2)
in the fall of 1995.  With the experience gained
from these missions, the various subsystems of
ASTROCULTURE
(tm) have been
highly refined, to the point where live plants including potatoes, dwarf
wheat, and mustard, have been flown on orbit successfully.
The ultimate goal of this advanced capability is to use the unique
environment of microgravity to grow plant materials which cannot be
obtained in normal earth gravity, but which will directly provide new
commercial products, or will help to develop new products through
enhanced research.  These products or product enhancements include
genetically engineered advanced crop materials
, unique methods of
long-term
storage and preservation
of plant materials, and natural plant
products with
pharmaceutical applications
.  Also available for
commercialization are the individual subsystems from
ASTROCULTURE
(tm),
including environmental control for large-scale commercial plant growing
facilities and a device to remove atmospheric hydrocarbons from enclosed
areas.

Facilities
WCSAR occupies a suite of offices and laboratories in the main building
of the College of Engineering.  This includes a modern CAD design
studio, a complete electronics shop and small machining area for
fabrication of prototypes, and several laboratory plant growth chambers.
Additional facilities for specific collaborative programs typically are
available through campus and industry colleagues.

Program Administration
WCSAR is a program of the College of Engineering, University of
Wisconsin-Madison.  A Management Advisory Board comprised of leaders
from the agricultural industry and from the financial sector provide
valuable input to WCSAR's Director, who works with industry colleagues
to set the goals for the program.  A fulltime staff of scientists and
engineers supply technical strength to the program.
