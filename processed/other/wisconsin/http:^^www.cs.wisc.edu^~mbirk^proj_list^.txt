Project List



Project Licp: No match.
p> What is
Project List
?  It is a small program (or script) that
manages a simple interface for viewing and modifying a "project list" - a
list of project descriptions, their authors, and hypertext links - on the
World Wide Web.  Since the interface is Web-based, the project list can be
easily examined or modified from just about anywhere, by anyone.

Project List
is for you if you are teaching a class (an
upper-level CS course, perhaps) in which your students work on substantial
projects, and you want to allow them to make information about their
projects publicly and easily accessible.

Project List
has three password modes.  You can try out
any of them:


No passwords
used at all
A single
class password
which must be used to modify the list

Individual passwords
for each project (anyone can add to the list)


Installation

If you are in the UW-CS department, then installation should be almost
trivial.  You can
download the install
program
or run it directly by typing:
~mbirk/public/html/proj_list/install_proj_list
when logged into your UNIX account.  (Of course, simply running this program
blindly is a security risk, but there's nothing stopping you from looking
at the script first.  Look before leaping!)  If you want to have more than one
project list, simply run the install program multiple times.

Note:
To use the
Project List
program at UW-CS, you must first
obtain a
CGI directory
.
To do this, send email to
www@cs.wisc.edu
,
and ask for a CGI directory to be created for you.
Using
Project List


Once you've installed
Project List
, using it to view or
modify the project list is a snap: you simply run the script by using
the correct Web address (URL).  For instance, you can test out
Project List
with the following URL:

http://cgi.cs.wisc.edu/scripts/mbirk/proj_list_test_no_passwd


There are some other things you might want to know:

The
proj_list
program creates a file with a
.db
extension in your data directory. This is simply a text file containing the
list information.  Fields (description, authors, web reference, and
password) are separated by
TAB
characters; rows, or items, are
separated by newlines.  Thus it is very simply to edit by hand.
You can empty the list by simply deleting the
.db
file (or
renaming it).

Technical Information


proj_list
is a
CGI
script written in the
Perl 5
scripting language.
Project List
uses the
CGI.pm
perl extension,
which makes it easy to create CGI programs that use forms (text input
fields, buttons, etc).
