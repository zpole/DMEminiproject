cs520 assignments



cs520 assignments
Fall 1996
Assignments are to be handed in, on paper, at the start of lecture.
If you will be absent from lecture, assignments may be placed in
my mailbox
before lecture starts
on the day they are due.
My mailbox is labled with "Brian Cole" in black letters on
lavender paper, and is on the fifth floor of the Computer Sciences
building (green elevators).
Late policy: Assignments turned in up to one lecture period late
are assessed a 20% penalty.
Assignments turned in more than one lecture period
late will not be graded.
Exceptions can be granted, rarely, but only if
arranged
in advance
of the due date.
Please note that
academic misconduct
is taken seriosly in cs520.
Make sure that the work you hand in is your own.

assignment due dates:


20 September 1996


4 October 1996


16 October 1996


29 October 1996


The T.A. has generously provided possible
solutions to the 4 October assignment
.
By popular demand, the
median scores
of graded work are available.
