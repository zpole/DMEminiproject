Optimization in Machine Learning

Optimization in Machine Learning
O. L. Mangasarian
MP-TR-95-01
January 1995
Optimization has played a significant role in training neural networks. This has resulted in a number of efficient algorithms and practical applications in medical diagnosis and prognosis. Other applications of neural networks abound. In this brief work we focus on a number of problems of machine learning and pose them as optimization problems. Hopefully this will point to further applications of optimization to the burgeoning field of machine learning.
